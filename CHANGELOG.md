## [2.5.2] - 2026-05-12 — chief-data-officer-advisor: data strategy without surveys

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **chief-data-officer-advisor** skill (`./c-level-advisor/skills/chief-data-officer-advisor/`) — opinionated, decision-driven CDO skill. Refuses to be a generic data-governance survey; instead answers four specific decisions:
  1. **Can we train our model on this data?** (AI training data rights matrix)
  2. **Warehouse, lakehouse, or mesh — and what do we build vs buy?** (data product strategy)
  3. **What is our customer data worth?** (B2B customer-data-as-asset valuation + M&A multiplier)
  4. **What data role do we hire next?** (data team org evolution)
- **3 stdlib Python tools with deterministic logic** (not pattern-match prose):
  - **`ai_training_data_audit.py`** — Audits data sources on 3 dimensions (origin × data class × use case). Returns GO/MITIGATE/NO-GO per source with risk, remediation, and GDPR Art. 6 + EU AI Act + US state citations. Embedded sample tests 7 sources spanning all 3 verdicts. Implements 6+ rule branches (scraped always NO-GO, regulated requires framework-specific consent, PII for fine-tuning requires explicit opt-in, etc.).
  - **`data_product_strategy_picker.py`** — Picks warehouse/lakehouse/mesh from a company profile (stage, consumers, data volume, ML models, culture). Returns architecture + 6-layer build-vs-buy decisions (storage, ELT, modeling, BI, feature store, ML platform) + 12-month sequencing roadmap. Deterministic: same profile → same recommendation. Embedded sample (Series A B2B SaaS, 8 consumers, 4.5TB, 1 ML model) → LAKEHOUSE recommendation.
  - **`data_asset_valuator.py`** — Computes strategic value 0-10 from 4 components (exclusivity, freshness, cohort breadth, history depth), derives moat strength (NONE/WEAK/MEDIUM/STRONG), applies M&A multiplier (1.0x–1.7x ARR depending on moat) with penalties for MSA carve-out rate and failed anonymization audit. Ranks 3 productization paths (benchmark report / embedding endpoint / direct license) by risk + viability. Embedded sample (B2B sales engagement corpus, 380 customers, 47 carve-outs) → 8.2/10 STRONG moat, 1.33-1.61x multiplier, recommends benchmark report as starting path.
- **4 references answering one decision each** (not topic surveys):
  - `ai_training_data_rights.md` — Decision: can we train on this source? Three-dimension matrix + GDPR Art. 6 lawful basis decision tree + EU AI Act high-risk triggers + US state patchwork (CCPA/CPRA, NYC LL 144, IL BIPA, WA MHMD).
  - `data_product_strategy.md` — Decision: which architecture and what do we build? Stage-driven kill criteria per architecture + 6-layer build-vs-buy decision tree + sequencing pattern + anti-patterns.
  - `customer_data_as_asset.md` — Decision: what's our data worth and can we productize it? 5-component valuation framework + M&A multiplier with carve-out impact + 3 productization paths with prerequisites + 10-item M&A diligence prep checklist + quarterly contractual constraint audit pattern.
  - `data_team_org_evolution.md` — Decision: what role next, when to centralize vs embed? 5-stage map (seed → late-stage) with specific role definitions + centralize-vs-embed-vs-federated triggers + 6 anti-patterns ("hiring data scientist as first data hire" etc.).
- **cs-cdo-advisor** agent (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/agents/cs-cdo-advisor.md`) — decision-driven realist orchestrating the skill. Voice: "What decision does this data drive?" Refuses to recommend tooling before naming the consumer. Treats AI training data as both contractual liability and strategic asset.
- **`/cs:cdo-review`** slash command (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/skills/cdo-review/SKILL.md`) — 6-question forcing interrogation pattern matching the /cs:cfo-review / /cs:gc-review etc. shape.
- **cs-cdo-advisor voice spec** added to `persona-voices.md`.

### Why This Matters

By 2026 every B2B SaaS founder is asking three questions the existing C-level skills can't fully answer:
1. **"Can we train our model on customer data?"** — overlaps cs-ciso (security), cs-general-counsel (contracts), and engineering (tactics), but none of them owns the strategic data picture.
2. **"What's the right data architecture — and when?"** — engineering's database-designer and observability-designer cover tactics, but the warehouse-vs-lakehouse-vs-mesh decision is stage-driven, not technology-driven.
3. **"What's our data actually worth in M&A?"** — this comes up at every Series B+ and has no home in existing skills.

This skill fills that gap with **deterministic decision logic** (not survey prose), explicit kill criteria, and a hard rule against duplicating engineering data skills.

### Built with Karpathy-Coder Discipline

This PR was the first in this repo built under explicit karpathy-coder guidance:
- **Principle 1 (Think before coding):** assumptions surfaced upfront, verifiable success criteria locked before any file was written.
- **Principle 2 (Simplicity first):** rejected "generic governance survey" framing; each tool/reference covers ONE decision; refused to add scope ("data product strategy picker" doesn't try to also do data quality, RAG, or schema design).
- **Principle 3 (Surgical changes):** touched only the files in the locked plan. Caught one scope-creep attempt (adding cs-general-counsel-advisor voice spec while editing persona-voices.md) and reverted it — that gap belongs in a separate PR.
- **Principle 4 (Goal-driven execution):** all 3 Python tools smoke-tested with embedded samples before commit (audit: 7 sources → 2 NO-GO / 2 MITIGATE / 3 GO; strategy picker: Series A → LAKEHOUSE; valuator: 8.2/10 STRONG moat).

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 264 → 265 (+1 chief-data-officer-advisor)
- **cs-* agents:** 29 → 30 (+1 cs-cdo-advisor in c-level-agents plugin)
- **/cs:* slash commands:** 17 → 18 (+1 /cs:cdo-review)
- **Python tools:** 361 → 364 (+3 in chief-data-officer-advisor/scripts/)
- **References:** 490 → 494 (+4 in chief-data-officer-advisor/references/)
- **c-level-skills** plugin: v2.5.1 → v2.5.2 (description expanded; 29 → 30 skills, 9 → 10 cs-* agents)
- **c-level-agents** plugin: v1.1.0 → v1.2.0 (description expanded with CDO; new agent; +`chief-data-officer`, `cdo`, `ai-training-data`, `data-product-strategy`, `data-as-asset` keywords)

### Known follow-ups (NOT included this PR per surgical scope)

- The `cs-general-counsel-advisor` voice spec is missing from `persona-voices.md` (introduced in v2.5.1 but not added to the voice reference). Will be addressed in a separate small PR alongside other voice cleanup.
- Phase 2 remainder (4 more C-roles: CAIO AI, CCO customer, VPE engineering execution, CCO comms) deferred to v2.5.3+.

### Disclaimer

The `chief-data-officer-advisor` skill surfaces strategic decisions but is **not legal advice** for AI training, **not a replacement for outside counsel** for productization/licensing decisions, and **not a tactical data engineering skill**. For tactical data engineering, see the engineering/ domain (`database-designer`, `observability-designer`, `data-quality-auditor`, `sql-database-assistant`, `rag-architect`, `llm-cost-optimizer`).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-12 — general-counsel-advisor: the gstack-can't-touch lane

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **general-counsel-advisor** skill (`./c-level-advisor/skills/general-counsel-advisor/`) — full standalone C-role skill backing the `/cs:gc-review` command (which previously had no underlying skill). 2 stdlib Python tools, 3 reference docs.
  - **`contract_risk_scanner.py`** — Scans contract text for 12 founder-killer clause patterns: auto-renewal with long notice (>30 day), customer-indemnity-carved-out-from-cap, one-sided indemnity, vague IP ownership, aggressive non-compete (>1 year), one-sided choice-of-law/venue, one-sided force majeure, missing DPA when personal data flows, MFN pricing, one-sided audit rights, broad non-solicit, perpetual license-back. Outputs ranked findings (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM) with excerpt, why-it-matters, and suggested redline. Stdlib-only, JSON or text output. Embedded sample MSA detects 7 risks across all 3 severity levels.
  - **`term_sheet_analyzer.py`** — Scores a term sheet 0-100 across 12 dimensions: liquidation preference (1x non-participating vs participating vs multi-preference), anti-dilution (broad-based weighted average vs narrow vs full ratchet), option pool (pre-money vs post-money + size), board composition (founder vs investor vs independent seats), vesting + acceleration (single vs double trigger), pro-rata, drag-along (founder consent / price floor), protective provisions (NVCA standard vs aggressive), information rights, dividends (none / non-cumulative / cumulative), valuation/dilution sanity, holistic posture. Outputs FOUNDER_FRIENDLY / NEGOTIATE / HOSTILE grade plus per-clause flags. Stdlib-only, JSON-input + JSON-or-text output.
  - **`references/contracts_playbook.md`** — 7 standard startup contracts (MSA, customer SaaS, NDA, DPA, employment, contractor, equity), top redlines per type, quick triage heuristics.
  - **`references/ip_and_regulatory.md`** — Full IP strategy (patents, copyright, trademark, trade secrets, invention assignment, OSS license compliance for permissive/weak-copyleft/strong-copyleft including AGPL) plus regulatory trigger matrix (HIPAA, PCI DSS, BSA/AML, FDA 510(k), MDR, GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, securities, ITAR, EU AI Act, telehealth, insurance) with SOC 2 → ISO 27001 → ISO 42001 sequencing and when-to-hire-a-GC criteria.
  - **`references/term_sheet_decoder.md`** — Full term sheet glossary, founder-friendly defaults cheat sheet, the three clauses that matter most (liquidation preference, option pool pre/post-money, anti-dilution), and negotiation strategy.
- **cs-general-counsel-advisor** agent (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/agents/cs-general-counsel-advisor.md`) — risk-paranoid persona orchestrating the skill via `/cs:gc-review`. Distinct voice: "Before we sign, three things need to be settled in writing." Hard rule: never gives definitive legal advice; always escalates to qualified outside counsel.
- **`/cs:gc-review`** updated to invoke the new tools and reference the skill (the command previously pointed at a planned skill with a CHANGELOG note).

### Why This Matters

YC Garry Tan's `gstack` has zero coverage for General Counsel — its "executives" are all software-shipping personas (CEO = scope-cutter, Eng Mgr = test matrix). But legal exposure is where startups most often discover a problem after it's expensive to fix: a missed DPA exposes the company to GDPR fines, vague IP clauses kill acquisition deals years later, full-ratchet anti-dilution silently transfers 5-15% of founder equity at the next down round. This is the first plugin in the founder-mode lineup to outclass gstack on a domain it doesn't even attempt.

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 263 → 264 (+1 general-counsel-advisor)
- **cs-* agents:** 28 → 29 (+1 cs-general-counsel-advisor in c-level-agents plugin)
- **Python tools:** 359 → 361 (+2 in general-counsel-advisor/scripts/)
- **References:** 487 → 490 (+3 in general-counsel-advisor/references/)
- **c-level-skills** plugin: v2.5.0 → v2.5.1 (description expanded; 28 → 29 skills, 8 → 9 cs-* agents)
- **c-level-agents** plugin: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 (description expanded with General Counsel; new agent added; +`contract-review`, `term-sheet`, `ip-strategy` keywords)

### Disclaimer

The `general-counsel-advisor` skill and `cs-general-counsel-advisor` agent are **not legal advice**. Every output surfaces questions to bring to qualified counsel; both Python tools and all 3 references repeatedly remind users to engage licensed attorneys for binding decisions. The skill is positioned as a triage layer — useful for catching the obvious traps before $500/hour counsel time, never as a substitute.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-12 — c-level-agents: Founder-Mode Executive Team

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **c-level-agents** plugin (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/`) — surfaces the existing 28 c-level skills through a founder-mode interface of cs-* persona agents and `/cs:*` slash commands. New marketplace entry registered separately (category: leadership).
- **8 new cs-* persona agents** with distinct cognitive voices, completing agent coverage for every C-role:
  - `cs-cfo-advisor` (numerate skeptic) wraps cfo-advisor
  - `cs-cmo-advisor` (narrative-first) wraps cmo-advisor
  - `cs-cro-advisor` (pipeline-paranoid) wraps cro-advisor
  - `cs-cpo-advisor` (JTBD-driven) wraps cpo-advisor
  - `cs-coo-advisor` (execution OS) wraps coo-advisor
  - `cs-chro-advisor` (people-systems) wraps chro-advisor
  - `cs-ciso-advisor` (risk-paranoid) wraps ciso-advisor
  - `cs-chief-of-staff` (router & synthesist) wraps chief-of-staff
- **17 /cs:* slash commands** delivered as sub-skills under `c-level-agents/skills/`:
  - **Forcing-question office hours (8):** `/cs:office-hours` (YC-style 6-question intake), `/cs:cfo-review`, `/cs:cmo-review`, `/cs:cpo-review`, `/cs:cro-review`, `/cs:cto-review`, `/cs:ciso-review`, `/cs:gc-review` (General Counsel — a lane gstack has zero of)
  - **Strategic sprint pipeline (5):** `/cs:brief` → `/cs:boardroom` (6-phase deliberation with Phase 2 isolation + devil's advocate pass) → `/cs:decide` (two-layer memory log with preserved dissent) → `/cs:execute` (90-day plan with weekly milestones + DRIs) → `/cs:post-mortem` (scored against pre-committed criteria and revisited dissent)
  - **Meta + safety (4):** `/cs:founder-mode` (auto-router — the killer command), `/cs:onboard` (12-question founder interview → `~/.claude/company-context.md`), `/cs:cross-eval` (multi-model consensus with graceful degradation to Claude-only adversarial mode when Codex/Gemini absent), `/cs:freeze` (cooldown lock on irreversible decisions with `/cs:unfreeze` audit trail)
- **References:** `c-level-agents/references/persona-voices.md` (voice specs per role — moderate aggression: bookend opening + closing, neutral analysis body) and `c-level-agents/references/llm-wiki-bridge.md` (Markdown-only persistent memory via `llm-wiki` — the answer to gstack's gbrain Postgres+pgvector dependency).
- **c-level-skills marketplace entry** description expanded and version bumped to v2.5.0 to reflect the bundled plugin layer.

### Why This Matters

Garry Tan's `gstack` (~66K stars) demonstrated the power of slash-command-first, forcing-question agent gearing — but its "executives" are all software-shipping personas (CEO = scope-cutter, Eng Mgr = test matrix). This release brings the same pattern to **real business decisions**: CFO with unit economics, CMO with positioning, General Counsel with contract risk, CISO with threat modeling, and a 6-phase boardroom that surpasses gstack's sequential review chain with Phase 2 isolation + adversarial pass. Combined with this repo's pre-existing compliance (ra-qm-team), finance, marketing, business-growth, and product domains, this is the business-domain answer to founder-mode — broader role coverage, real frameworks, Markdown-only memory, and explicit voice differentiation.

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 246 → 263 (+17 from c-level-agents sub-skills)
- **cs-* agents:** 20 → 28 (+8 new c-level personas inside the plugin)
- **Slash commands:** 33 → 50 (+17 /cs:* commands as sub-skills)
- **Marketplace plugins:** 33 → 34 (+1 c-level-agents entry)
- **c-level-skills** plugin: v2.2.3 → v2.5.0

## [2.4.5] - 2026-05-11 — Reliability Portfolio + Count-Truth Reconciliation

### Added — Engineering POWERFUL

- **slo-architect** — End-to-end SLO/SLI/error-budget discipline per Google SRE Workbook. Generates structured SLO definitions and refuses to render if required fields (owner, error-budget policy, SLI numerator/denominator) are missing (`slo_designer.py`). Computes error budget and the canonical multi-window burn-rate alert thresholds — fast (1h/5m, page), slow (6h/30m, page), ticket (3d/6h) — with PromQL-shaped output ready to paste (`error_budget_calculator.py`). Reviews existing SLO docs for the 7 common bugs: target too high (≥99.99%), target too low (≤99%), window too short (<7d), window too long (>90d), no SLI definition, no error budget policy, CPU-as-SLI (`slo_review.py`). 4 references on SLO principles, SLI design (5 types), error budget math, and composition with the rest of the portfolio. Asset templates for SLO YAML and error budget policy. New `/slo-design` slash command. Karpathy complexity 95/100. Composes explicitly with feature-flags-architect (rollout abort uses SLO burn-rate), chaos-engineering (blast-radius bounded by SLO error budget), kubernetes-operator (Capability Level 4 requires SLOs).
- **ship-gate** — Pre-production audit skill from external contributor @rx4u (originally PR #527, re-applied to post-restructure dev layout). Scans codebases across 8 categories — security, database, deployment, code quality, AI/LLM, dependencies, frontend, observability — with 89 automated and manual checks. Intercepts deploy-intent phrases ("push to production", "ship it", "go live") and blocks until critical issues resolve. Stack-agnostic (Node/Next/React/Vue/Svelte/Astro/Express/Python/Django/Flask/etc.). Stdlib-only Python scanner (`ship_gate_scanner.py`, ~1230 LOC) with JSON output, ANSI color, interactive manual prompts, and exit codes (0=CLEAR, 1=CRITICAL, 2=HIGH).
- **feature-flags-architect** — End-to-end feature-flag discipline. Detects stale flags as debt (`flag_debt_scanner.py`), generates phased rollout plans across ring/linear/log/cohort strategies (`rollout_planner.py`), and audits every flag for documented kill switch (`kill_switch_audit.py`). 4 references on flag taxonomy, provider comparison (LaunchDarkly / GrowthBook / Statsig / Unleash / Flipt / DIY), rollout strategies, and lifecycle. Ships standalone plugin AND in the engineering-advanced-skills bundle. New `/flag-cleanup` slash command.
- **kubernetes-operator** — End-to-end Kubernetes Operator discipline. Validates CRDs against operator-pattern best practices (`crd_validator.py`), lints Go reconcile functions for anti-patterns like `time.Sleep`, spec mutation, missing requeue, finalizer imbalance (`reconcile_lint.py`), and scores operators against OperatorHub Capability Levels 1-5 (`operator_capability_audit.py`). 4 references on operator pattern, CRD design, reconcile loop patterns, and framework comparison (controller-runtime / kubebuilder / operator-sdk / metacontroller / KOPF). Asset templates for production CRD YAML and Go controller skeleton (both pass linters). New `/operator-audit` slash command. NOT a generic k8s skill — specifically the Operator pattern. Self-tested: linters caught 4 real bugs in their own asset templates during build.
- **chaos-engineering** — End-to-end chaos engineering discipline. Generates structured experiment plans with hypothesis + steady-state + blast-radius + abort-criteria (`experiment_designer.py`), computes blast radius with GREEN/YELLOW/RED risk score against monthly error budget (`blast_radius_calculator.py`), and produces blameless postmortems with blame-language detection (`experiment_postmortem.py`). 4 references on the 4 founding principles + 5th abort-criteria principle, hypothesis/steady-state/abort design, the 7-attack taxonomy (latency / error / resource / network-partition / dependency / time / infrastructure), and tooling landscape (Chaos Toolkit / Chaos Mesh / Litmus / Gremlin / AWS FIS / DIY). Templates for plans and postmortems. New `/chaos-experiment` slash command. Composes explicitly with feature-flags-architect (kill switches as abort triggers) and kubernetes-operator (operators are common chaos targets). Karpathy complexity 95/100 — best score in the new portfolio.

### Added — Repo infrastructure

- **scripts/sync_skill_bundles.py** — mirror standalone plugin payloads into their domain-bundled location; `--check` exits 1 on drift, `--sync` rewrites the mirror. Locks in the dual-publish invariant for every new skill.
- **scripts/check_plugin_json.py** — strict ClawHub schema validator (exactly 8 fields, semver, `author{name,url}`, `skills` as string or array — bare `"./"` rejected per Claude Code v2.1.107+). Verified against all 31 existing plugin.json files.

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 235 (v2.3.0 claim) → 246 (file-system truth via `find . -name SKILL.md` minus 4 distribution duplicates). +5 new skills this cycle (slo-architect, ship-gate, feature-flags-architect, kubernetes-operator, chaos-engineering); +6 discovered during #608/#609 reconciliation.
- **Python tools:** 314 → 359 (`find . -path '*/scripts/*.py' | wc -l`)
- **References:** 435 → 485 (`find . -path '*/references/*.md' | wc -l`)
- **Agents:** 28 → 27 (file-system truth: 20 `cs-*` + 7 personas. Previous "30" miscounted README/TEMPLATE as agents)
- **Slash commands:** 27 → 33 (`find commands -name '*.md' | wc -l`)
- **Marketplace plugins:** 30 → 33 (registered in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
- **engineering-advanced-skills** plugin: v2.3.3 → v2.4.2
- **marketplace.json**: `feature-flags-architect`, `kubernetes-operator`, and `chaos-engineering` registered as standalone plugins

### Fixed

- `tests/test_skill_integrity.py::TestScriptDirectories::test_scripts_dirs_have_python_files` — was rejecting valid skills shipping `.mjs`/`.js`/`.ts`/`.sh` scripts (e.g., `full-page-screenshot`). Now accepts any executable script extension while keeping the "scripts/ dir is non-empty" intent.
- **#608, #609 — Count claims aligned to ground-truth.** Every metric in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`, `mkdocs.yml`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` now reproduces from a deterministic `find` or `python3 -c "import json"` command. Stale claims of "188 skills", "30 agents", "3 personas", "235 skills" (current-state) were replaced with file-system truth. Per-domain marketplace breakdown also reconciled: engineering-advanced 40→67 unique, engineering-core 32→51, marketing 44→45, c-level 28→34, product 13→17, finance 3→4. Domains ra-qm-team (14), project-management (9), business-growth (5) unchanged.
- **skill-security-auditor** — self-skip false positives via `noqa` directive (the auditor was flagging its own scanner code).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added — Security Skills Suite & Self-Eval

**6 New Security Skills (engineering-team):**
- **adversarial-reviewer** — Adversarial code review with 3 hostile personas (Saboteur, New Hire, Security Auditor) to break self-review monoculture
