## [2.7.3] - 2026-05-17 — aeo-box port: AEO skill + security-guidance PreToolUse hook

### Added

**Ported `alirezarezvani/aeo-box` after a full component audit.** Two new skills, one preserved megaprompt, and a Hermes Agent install/configure walkthrough.

#### `marketing-skill/skills/aeo/` — Answer Engine Optimization

A discipline distinct from SEO. AEO optimizes content for **citation** in LLM-generated responses (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, Mistral); SEO optimizes for search rankings. New 8th pod in marketing-skill.

- `aeo_audit.py` — E-E-A-T + structure scoring, 0-100 composite with letter grade. 8 industries with calibrated thresholds (YMYL industries 85+, SaaS/b2b/media 70, ecommerce 65).
- `aeo_optimizer.py` — Content rewriting in 3 modes (conservative/balanced/aggressive). Auto-injects schema.org Article + FAQPage JSON-LD.
- `citation_tracker.py` — Local-first citation ledger at `~/.aeo-data/citations.json`. Stats: count, LLM coverage, velocity, top queries, verdict (EARLY / EMERGING / STRONG).
- 3 references each citing 8 sources: E-E-A-T canon (Google QRG adapted for LLM citation), per-LLM citation patterns (with 73% cross-LLM correlation analysis), AEO-vs-SEO strategic choice.
- `cs-aeo` agent (pragmatic content strategist; refuses fake authority signals) + `/cs:aeo` slash command.

#### `engineering/security-guidance/` — PreToolUse security hook

Ported from David Dworken (@dworken) at Anthropic (MIT). PreToolUse hook that catches 12 security anti-patterns in Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations **before** they're written:

| Pattern | Upstream | Added in this port |
|---|:-:|:-:|
| `child_process.exec` / `execSync` | ✓ | |
| `new Function` | ✓ | |
| `eval(` | ✓ | |
| `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | ✓ | |
| `document.write` | ✓ | |
| `.innerHTML =` | ✓ | |
| `pickle` | ✓ | |
| `os.system` | ✓ | |
| GitHub Actions workflow injection | ✓ | |
| `subprocess shell=True` | | ✓ |
| SQL via f-string or `.format` | | ✓ |
| `yaml.unsafe_load` | | ✓ |

Session-state caching prevents nagging (warn once per file+rule combo); 30-day auto-cleanup; disable per-session with `ENABLE_SECURITY_REMINDER=0`. Full `attribution` block in plugin.json credits the upstream.

#### `megaprompts/14-aeo-agentic-megaprompt.md`

1,579-line multi-agent AEO application spec preserved verbatim. Keeps Path-B option open for future "build the full agentic AEO app" work.

#### `docs/integrations.md` — Hermes Agent install/configure walkthrough

Earlier user-flagged docs gap: nowhere did the repo tell users HOW to install Hermes Agent itself (only how to install our skills INTO Hermes). Added macOS/Linux/Windows install paths, complete first-run walkthrough, sample `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, and a 6 Q&A troubleshooting section.

### Changed

- **Marketplace**: 55 → 57 plugins. Top-level + metadata descriptions updated to v2.7.3 / 313 skills.
- **Domain plugin.json**: `marketing-skill/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` description updated from "44 skills across 7 pods" → "45 skills across 8 pods" (adds AEO pod). Version bumped 2.2.3 → 2.7.3.
- **CLAUDE.md**: root + marketing-skill CLAUDE.md refreshed to 313/402/542 counts.
- **README.md**: badges (313 / 46+ / 60+), Skills Overview table row counts, FAQ counts.
- **docs/index.md + getting-started.md + mkdocs.yml**: title, meta description, hero subtitle, grid cards, nav entries.
- **MkDocs**: 401 → 403 generated pages (296 skill + 73 agent + 34 command).

### Layout fix (during /plugin-audit Phase 7)

- Moved `marketing-skill/agents/cs-aeo.md` → `agents/marketing/cs-aeo.md` (repo convention: agents live at root `agents/<domain>/`).
- Moved `marketing-skill/commands/cs-aeo.md` → `commands/cs-aeo.md` (repo convention: commands live at root `commands/`).
- Cleaned empty `marketing-skill/agents/` and `marketing-skill/commands/` directories.
- Without this fix, `scripts/generate-docs.py` wouldn't have generated docs/agents/cs-aeo.md or docs/commands/cs-aeo.md.

### Cross-platform sync

- `.codex/skills-index.json`: 303 → 305 skills.
- `.gemini/skills-index.json`: 353 → 355 items.
- `.hermes/skills/claude-skills/skills-index.json`: 305 skills across 12 domains.

### Honest assessments from /plugin-audit (both skills)

**aeo**: PASS WITH WARNINGS — structure 86.4/GOOD, quality 52.4/D (validator expects legacy frontmatter fields v2.7 skills don't use), 3/3 scripts PASS, 2 HIGH security findings (NET-EXFIL from `urllib.request` — same known false-positive as sister `seo-audit` skill; URL fetch is core functionality for content-audit-by-URL tools).

**security-guidance**: PASS WITH WARNINGS — structural mismatch (validators assume `scripts/` layout, hook plugins use `hooks/` per Claude Code spec), 6 CRITICAL + 4 HIGH security findings are all recursive false-positives (the auditor detects the hook's own pattern-strings like `"exec("`, `"eval("`, `"yaml.load("` as actual calls — verified zero real exec/eval calls). Live smoke test: `eval(input())` in Write tool → exit 2 + warning. **Real defects: 0.**

### PRs

#678 (Hermes first-class integration) → #679 (aeo-box port + Hermes install guide) → this PR (v2.7.3 release: docs sync + layout fix + CHANGELOG + audit).

### Verification

- All 4 new Python tools pass `--help` and `--sample`.
- Security hook smoke-tested: exit 2 on detection, exit 0 on cached/clean.
- All 3 cross-platform syncs ran clean.
- MkDocs build: exit 0, 450 HTML pages generated.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-05-16 — v2 megaprompt-to-skill conversion sweep: 13 new skills (productivity + marketing + research)

### Added — 13 Path-B Skills From `megaprompts/`

This release ships the complete v2 megaprompt collection (`megaprompts/01-13`) as production-ready skills using the **Path-B direct-conversion pattern**: each megaprompt's body becomes the SKILL.md verbatim, wrapped in the standard 11-file plugin layout (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, README, agent, command, SKILL.md, 3 references citing 7+ sources each, 3 stdlib Python scripts).

Three new top-level domain folders were created to host the 13 skills:

| Domain | Skills | Build pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `productivity/` | `capture`, `email` (paired: inbox-setup + inbox-triage), `reflect` | Personal-productivity slices — single-action intake, KB-file contract between pair |
| `marketing/` | `landing` | Single-file HTML landing-page generator with 4 design styles |
| `research/` | `pulse`, `litreview`, `grants`, `dossier`, `patent`, `syllabus`, `notebooklm`, `research` (orchestrator) | 7 research-pack siblings + 1 hybrid router |

**13 skills, 142 files, 23,698 lines of code + documentation.** All scripts stdlib-only. All references cite 7+ authoritative sources.

#### Productivity slice (3 skills)

- **`productivity/capture/`** (PR #659) — Brain-dump-to-action workspace. Classify→cluster→connect→clarify intake. Path-B from megaprompt 05.
- **`productivity/email/`** (PR #661) — Email-workflow skill pair. `inbox-setup` builds taxonomy/KB; `inbox-triage` classifies + drafts (drafts-only, never auto-send). 7-file KB contract between them. Path-B from megaprompts 06+07.
- **`productivity/reflect/`** (PR #668) — Light-prompt reflection sibling of capture. Path-B from megaprompt 08.

#### Marketing slice (1 skill)

- **`marketing/landing/`** (PR #662) — Single-file HTML landing-page generator. 4 design styles, brand palette validator, GSAP animation patterns, kebab-slug URL hygiene. Path-B from megaprompt 04.

#### Research pack (8 skills — 7 specialists + 1 orchestrator)

- **`research/pulse/`** (PR #660) — Multi-source recency research (Reddit/HN/X/web sentiment + trending). Research-pack convention. Path-B from megaprompt 01.
- **`research/litreview/`** (PR #663) — Academic literature orientation. PICO/SPIDER frameworks, systematic review structure, 8-section DOCX guide. Path-B from megaprompt 09.
- **`research/grants/`** (PR #664) — NIH grant-funding intelligence. RePORTER/NOSI/study-section navigation, R01/R21/K-award strategy. Path-B from megaprompt 11.
- **`research/dossier/`** (PR #664) — Decision-grade entity research. Due-diligence/background-check/competitor-prep with tier-weighted verdict + citation tracker. Path-B from megaprompt 02.
- **`research/patent/`** (PR #666) — Patent prior-art + IP landscape. FTO/novelty/family-resolver via 3-pass Jaccard heuristic. Path-B from megaprompt 12.
- **`research/syllabus/`** (PR #666) — Course supplementary-reading skill. Topic-grouper + bundled Node.js DOCX generator. Path-B from megaprompt 10.
- **`research/notebooklm/`** (PR #669) — Google NotebookLM browser-automation. 4 actions (read/extract, add-source, Studio outputs, create notebook). Screenshot-first + find-before-click + fire-and-notify discipline. Path-B from megaprompt 03.
- **`research/research/`** (PR #671) — **Research orchestrator (hybrid router + fallback).** Deterministic SIGNALS classification routes to the 6 specialists above at ≥2-signal confidence, else runs own 8-step plan-decompose-search-synthesize-cite fallback. Routing transparency mandatory. Distinct from `engineering/autoresearch-agent` (Karpathy's file-optimization loop). Path-B from megaprompt 13.

### Added — Marketplace + Codex Registry

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`**: 43 → 55 plugins. 12 new entries (email-pair holds 2 skills) across 3 categories. New categories added: `productivity`, `research`.
- **`.codex/skills-index.json`**: 290 → 303 entries. 13 new skills indexed with category metadata.
- **`.codex/skills/` symlinks**: 11 new symlinks created (capture + pulse already existed from prior auto-sync).
- **`scripts/sync-codex-skills.py`**: Added `productivity/`, `marketing/`, `research/` to `SKILL_DOMAINS` so future auto-sync runs pick up the new top-level domains.

### Path-B Convention (Documented)

This release formalizes the **Path-B direct-conversion** pattern for future megaprompt-derived skills:

- Megaprompt body → SKILL.md preserving content verbatim
- 11-file standard plugin layout (12 files for skills with bundled JS DOCX generators like syllabus)
- 3 stdlib Python scripts per skill (no external deps)
- 3 reference docs per skill, each citing 7+ authoritative sources
- `cs-*` agent + `/cs:*` command per plugin
- `source` field in `plugin.json` documents `spec` (megaprompt path) + `build_pattern` + `distinct_from` (where disambiguation needed)

### Verification

- **39/39 scripts pass `--help`** across all 13 skills
- **8-phase plugin audit** on `research/research`: PASS WITH WARNINGS (structure 84.1/GOOD, scripts 3/3, security 0 findings)
- **Spot-check audit** on pulse / litreview / notebooklm: all 86.4/GOOD, 3/3 scripts, security PASS
- **Bulk audit** on remaining 9 skills: all 79.5-86.4 structure, 0 critical/high security findings (1 false positive in syllabus on a user-facing `npm install docx` error-message string literal)
- **Cross-skill consistency**: 7/7 research-pack siblings carry the `Agent Integrity Rules` block (1 q/sec rate limit, three-count tracking, retry-once-after-3s, source discipline)
- **Orchestrator disambiguation**: `distinct_from autoresearch-agent` callouts present in plugin.json + README + SKILL.md + agent + command (5 places)

### PRs

#659 (capture), #660 (pulse), #661 (email pair), #662 (landing), #663 (litreview), #664 (grants+dossier), #666 (patent+syllabus), #667 (domain-folder cleanup), #668 (reflect), #669 (notebooklm), #671 (research orchestrator), #672 (v2.7.0 release prep — this commit).

## [2.6.1] - 2026-05-14 — Meta-skill maturity: validator expansion + 21 placeholder descriptions + audit tool

### Added — Tooling

- **`scripts/audit_skills.py`** (`./scripts/audit_skills.py`) — repo-wide write-a-skill validator runner. Stdlib-only orchestration that walks every SKILL.md in the repo, runs `skill_review_checklist_runner.py` against each, and aggregates results (PASS/WARN/FAIL counts, failure-by-rule breakdown, top-10 worst offenders). Excludes auto-generated tool bundles (`.gemini/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.cline/`) and template fixtures. ~30s to run across 298 real skills. Merged via #646.

### Fixed — Validator False Positives

The v2.6.0 validators recognized only `Use when`, `Use for`, `Invoke when`, `Trigger when` as valid trigger phrases. But legacy skills had semantically-valid natural-English triggers like `Use before annual GDPR review` (gdpr-audit-prep). Expanded trigger patterns to include:

- `Use before/during/after/while ...`
- `Invoke before/after ...`
- `Apply when ...`
- `Run when/before ...`

**Impact: 30 legacy skills reclassified from FAIL → WARN/PASS automatically.** Karpathy `complexity_checker`: 100/100 PASS on both modified validators (`skill_description_validator.py` + `skill_review_checklist_runner.py`). Merged via #647.

### Fixed — 21 Placeholder Descriptions

The v2.6.0 audit revealed 21 skills (~7% of repo) whose description field was literally just the skill name (e.g., `description: "Migration Architect"`). These were real bugs from a v2.0.0 batch import. All 21 fixed in this release.

**Top-10 POWERFUL-tier engineering skills (merged via #647):**
- `migration-architect` — zero-downtime migration planning + rollback strategy
- `dependency-auditor` — vulnerabilities + license + safe-upgrade audit
- `codebase-onboarding` — codebase analysis + onboarding doc generation
- `ci-cd-pipeline-builder` — pragmatic CI/CD from project stack signals
- `mcp-server-builder` — MCP servers from OpenAPI contracts (Python + TS)
- `observability-designer` — metrics + logs + traces + SLI/SLO design
- `api-design-reviewer` — REST design review + breaking-change detection
- `performance-profiler` — Node/Python/Go profiling + flamegraphs + load tests
- `changelog-generator` — Conventional Commits → release notes automation
- `runbook-generator` — operational runbooks from service name + templates

**Remaining 11 across 4 domains (merged via #648):**
- `executive-mentor/skills/challenge` — pre-mortem plan analysis
- `executive-mentor/skills/board-prep` — adversarial board prep
- `git-worktree-manager` — parallel feature work with Git worktrees
- `skill-tester` — meta-skill QA (structure + script + quality scoring)
- `monorepo-navigator` — Turborepo / Nx / pnpm / Lerna navigation
- `env-secrets-manager` — env-var hygiene + secrets rotation
- `agent-workflow-designer` — production-grade multi-agent workflows
- `incident-commander` — incident response framework
- `email-template-builder` — React Email + provider integration
- `stripe-integration-expert` — subscriptions + webhooks + billing
- `contract-and-proposal-writer` — jurisdiction-aware business documents

Each new description: ≤1024 chars, third person, action verb in first sentence, "Use when ..." trigger in second sentence per Matt Pocock's rule.

### Changed — Quality Gates Reference

Updated `engineering/write-a-skill/skills/write-a-skill/references/quality_gates_for_skills.md` to formalize the **binding-for-new vs advisory-for-legacy split**. The 6-item checklist remains BLOCKING for post-v2.6.0 skills and ADVISORY for the 298 legacy SKILL.md files.

Why: forcing the gate as blocking would either delay every PR or require disabling the gate. The pragmatic split lets the repo grow the PASS count over time without force-marching 298 retrofits.

### Aggregate Audit Improvement

Against the 298 real-skill cohort (excludes auto-generated bundles):

| Metric | v2.6.0 baseline | v2.6.1 (now) | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ PASS (6/6) | 4 (1%) | **9 (3%)** | **+5** |
| 🟡 WARN (5/6) | 111 (37%) | **137 (46%)** | **+26** |
| 🔴 FAIL (≤4/6) | 183 (61%) | **152 (51%)** | **-31** |
| "Missing trigger" failures | 119 (39%) | **68 (23%)** | **-51** |

**31 skills total lifted from FAIL → WARN/PASS in v2.6.1.**

### PRs in v2.6.1

- #646 — `scripts/audit_skills.py` repo-wide audit harness
- #647 — validator trigger expansion + 10 placeholder description fixes + legacy advisory
- #648 — closes out remaining 11 placeholder description fixes

### What's Next (Not in This Release)

- **v2.6.2 candidate:** 27% terminology drift (agent/bot, skill/tool mixing). Larger scope; requires careful prose edits.
- **v2.7 candidate:** large-scale audit against the 100-line ceiling. 88% of legacy skills exceed it. Decide which top-20 high-traffic skills to refactor with `references/<topic>.md` splits.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-13 — Matt Pocock productivity skills: write-a-skill + caveman + grill-me + handoff

### Added — Engineering / Productivity (4 new skills, all MIT-licensed derivations)

- **write-a-skill** skill (`./engineering/write-a-skill/`) — skill-author meta-skill derived from [Matt Pocock's write-a-skill](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity/write-a-skill) (MIT). Matt's SKILL.md content + 3-phase workflow (Gather → Draft → Review) preserved verbatim per his MIT license.
  - **3 stdlib Python validation tools**: `skill_description_validator.py` (5-check verdict: present, ≤1024 chars, third person, "Use when" trigger, action verb in first sentence), `skill_structure_validator.py` (6-check verdict: SKILL.md present + ≤100 lines, references when split needed, one-level-deep, no circular refs, scripts/ folder note), `skill_review_checklist_runner.py` (combined 6-item runner per Matt's checklist).
  - **4 references** (7-8 sources each): progressive disclosure principles (Matt, Anthropic, Don Norman, Pirolli & Card, Maeda, DocOps, Pareto), description design patterns (Matt, Anthropic, Garrett, Nielsen Norman, Karpathy, SEO), quality gates (Matt, Humble & Farley, Kim et al., Hyrum's Law), companion tooling.
  - **cs-skill-author** persona agent (forcing-question interrogator).
  - **`/cs:write-a-skill`** slash command (6-question forcing interrogation mirroring Matt's review checklist).

- **caveman** skill (`./engineering/caveman/`) — token-compression mode derived from [Matt Pocock's caveman](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity/caveman) (MIT). Matt's persistence rules + auto-clarity exception preserved verbatim.
  - **3 stdlib Python tools**: `caveman_compressor.py` (deterministic application of Matt's rules — drop articles/filler/pleasantries/hedging, abbreviate technical terms, causality arrows; 20-50% typical reduction, 75% upper bound), `token_savings_estimator.py` (chars/token heuristic for prose vs technical text + $/Mtok cost extrapolation), `caveman_lint.py` (detects banned vocab with code-block + exception-zone whitelisting).
  - **3 references** (7-8 sources each): compression principles (Matt, Strunk & White, Plain Language Movement, Pinker, Williams, Anthropic, tokenizer heuristics), when caveman backfires (Matt, NN/g, FAA cockpit-warning research, Krug, Schneier, Larson), companion tooling.
  - **cs-caveman-mode** persona agent (persistence-enforced operator).
  - **`/cs:caveman`** slash command.

- **grill-me** skill (`./engineering/grill-me/`) — relentless plan-interrogator derived from [Matt Pocock's grill-me](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity/grill-me) (MIT). Matt's one-at-a-time interview discipline preserved verbatim.
  - **3 stdlib Python tools**: `decision_tree_extractor.py` (6 branch kinds: intent / choice / open / tradeoff / dependency / question), `question_generator.py` (forcing questions with recommended answers + dependency-aware ordering), `grill_session_tracker.py` (JSON-backed state in `~/.grill_sessions/` for multi-day grills).
  - **3 references** (7-8 sources each): forcing-question patterns (Matt, Socratic Method, YC office-hours, 5 Whys, Cockburn, Popper, Galef, Larson), when to stop grilling (Matt, Galef, Kahneman, Bezos Type 1/2 decisions, YC Founder School, Cynefin), companion tooling.
  - **cs-grill-master** persona agent (one-question-at-a-time enforcer with codebase-exploration-first discipline).
  - **`/cs:grill-me`** slash command.

- **handoff** skill (`./engineering/handoff/`) — conversation-continuity generator derived from [Matt Pocock's handoff](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/tree/main/skills/productivity/handoff) (MIT). Matt's no-duplication discipline + `mktemp` convention preserved verbatim.
  - **3 stdlib Python tools**: `handoff_template_generator.py` (5-section scaffold tailored to 5 next-session emphases: deploy/review/debug/design/test/default; honors Matt's `mktemp -t handoff-XXXXXX.md`), `artifact_deduplicator.py` (detects PRD/ADR/issue/commit/long-code-block duplication with reference suggestions), `skill_recommender.py` (matches handoff content to 14 skills in this repo, ranked by signal strength).
  - **4 references** (7-8 sources each): handoff structure (Matt, DRY, runbook patterns, Atlassian, GitHub PR conventions, Anthropic, Kim et al.), deduplication discipline (Matt, Hunt & Thomas, Fowler, DocOps, Karpathy LLM Wiki, git-as-source-of-truth, Stripe API versioning), next-session skill matching (Matt, Anthropic, TF-IDF/BM25, recommender systems, Karpathy, Hyrum's Law), companion tooling.
  - **cs-handoff-author** persona agent (no-duplication-tolerated).
  - **`/cs:handoff <next-session-focus>`** slash command with argument-hint per Matt's convention.

### Attribution

All four skills derive from [Matt Pocock's MIT-licensed skills repo](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) — *"Skills for Real Engineers. Straight from my .claude directory"*. Matt's SKILL.md content reproduced verbatim under MIT. Attribution in every file: README.md + plugin.json `attribution` block + SKILL.md frontmatter metadata + agent + command + reference footers.

### The Pattern (Hybrid Voice Approach)

This release establishes the pattern for deriving MIT-licensed external skills into this repo:

1. **Preserve upstream voice verbatim** in SKILL.md
2. **Add wrapper layer**: stdlib Python validation tools + 3-4 references (each citing ≥ 5 authoritative sources) + cs-* persona agent + /cs:* slash command
3. **Karpathy-coder gate** before merge (complexity_checker + assumption_linter)
4. **Attribution discipline** in plugin.json + README + every file footer

### Verified

- **12 Python tools** total: 100/100 complexity across all (0 findings) — karpathy `complexity_checker` PASS
- **13 references** total: 7-8 authoritative sources each (well over the ≥ 5 floor)
- **All 4 SKILL.md** PASS write-a-skill's own 6-item review checklist (the meta-skill dogfooded)
- **SKILL.md sizes**: 144 (write-a-skill, wrapper preserves Matt's full content), 69 (caveman), 58 (grill-me), 41 (handoff) — three of four under Matt's 100-line ceiling; write-a-skill documented exception (verbatim preservation overhead)
- **pytest**: 1,921 tests passing
- **CI**: PR 2 caught the missing H1 issue via `test_skill_integrity.py` (test suite worked as designed); fixed in a follow-up commit before merge

### Documented Trade-offs

- **assumption_linter false positives** on `caveman_compressor.py`, `caveman_lint.py`, `artifact_deduplicator.py`, `handoff_template_generator.py`, `skill_recommender.py`: the linter flags banned-vocabulary strings (just, simply, fix, refactor, of course) that appear inside the tools' DATA dictionaries — these strings exist precisely to be detected. Documented as expected; no code change.
- **caveman compression ratio**: Matt's stated "~75%" is the upper bound on extremely verbose responses with multiple pleasantries + filler + hedging. Realistic compression on typical mid-conversation text is 20-50%. Documented in `compression_principles.md`.

### PRs

- PR #642 — write-a-skill alone (merged 2026-05-13)
- PR #643 — caveman + grill-me + handoff batch (merged 2026-05-13)

## [2.5.7] - 2026-05-13 — Docs site refresh: nav additions, dual-publish dedup, 301 redirects

### Added

- **5 new C-role docs pages** added to `mkdocs.yml` nav (C-Level Advisory section): General Counsel Advisor, Chief Data Officer Advisor, Chief AI Officer Advisor, Chief Customer Officer Advisor, VP Engineering Advisor.
- **13 new cs-* agent docs pages** added to `mkdocs.yml` nav (Agents section): cs-cfo / cs-cmo / cs-cro / cs-cpo / cs-coo / cs-chro / cs-ciso / cs-chief-of-staff / cs-general-counsel / cs-cdo / cs-caio / cs-cco / cs-vpe.
- **`mkdocs-redirects` plugin** added to `mkdocs.yml` plugins list. Provides client-side redirects (meta-refresh + JS fallback) — Google's SERP indexing treats meta-refresh with delay=0 as 301-equivalent.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/generate-docs.py` dedup bug:** the auto-generator created BOTH `<name>.md` (bundled) AND `<name>-<name>.md` (standalone wrapper) for dual-published skills, producing duplicate-content pages. The dedup now detects the dual-publish pattern (`<domain>/<name>/skills/<same-name>/SKILL.md` paired with `<domain>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) and skips the standalone mirror in favor of the bundled (canonical) version.
- **4 pre-existing engineering dual-publish duplicate pages deleted** with 301-equivalent redirects:
  - `skills/engineering/chaos-engineering-chaos-engineering.md` → `skills/engineering/chaos-engineering.md`
  - `skills/engineering/feature-flags-architect-feature-flags-architect.md` → `skills/engineering/feature-flags-architect.md`
  - `skills/engineering/kubernetes-operator-kubernetes-operator.md` → `skills/engineering/kubernetes-operator.md`
  - `skills/engineering/slo-architect-slo-architect.md` → `skills/engineering/slo-architect.md`
  - All 4 old URLs redirect to the canonical page; existing Google SERP indexes preserved.

### Changed

- **`mkdocs.yml` `site_description`** — updated from "246 skills, 20 cs-* agents" (6 versions stale) to current "268 skills, 33 cs-* agents (incl. founder-mode C-suite), 21 /cs:* slash commands."
- **`README.md`** — header counts updated: 246 → 268 skills; 20 → 33 agents; 33 → 54 commands; 359 → 373 Python tools. Subtitle expanded with founder-mode lineup callout.
- **`.github/workflows/static.yml`** — install step updated from `pip install mkdocs-material` to `pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-redirects` to support the new plugin.

### Verified

- `mkdocs build` succeeds (357 HTML pages generated)
- Redirect HTML correctly emitted with `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=...">` + JavaScript fallback that preserves URL anchors
- karpathy `diff_surgeon`: clean on staged diff
- 71 pre-existing skill pages preserved (no SEO equity loss)

### Pre-existing (not addressed in this PR)

13 INFO-level link warnings exist from before this session (broken anchors and relative-link-without-index hints). These are pre-existing in the docs and not introduced or worsened by this PR. Tracked as a separate cleanup if desired.

## [2.5.6] - 2026-05-13 — Cleanup: missing voice specs + broken agent paths

### Fixed

- **3 missing voice specs added to `c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/references/persona-voices.md`:**
  - `cs-ceo-advisor` — The Strategic Translator (tree-of-thought reasoning; refuses to debate tactics until the strategic question is named)
  - `cs-cto-advisor` — The Architecture-First Pragmatist (ReAct reasoning; treats every architecture decision as a 3-year commitment)
  - `cs-general-counsel-advisor` — The Risk-Paranoid Lawyer (Not Your Lawyer) — carry-over from v2.5.1
  - All three agents existed but their voice specs were never added to the persona reference (cs-ceo / cs-cto pre-date the c-level-agents plugin; cs-gc was an oversight in v2.5.1).
- **Broken paths fixed in 2 pre-existing agent files** (`agents/c-level/cs-ceo-advisor.md` and `agents/c-level/cs-cto-advisor.md`):
  - All 57 references to `../../c-level-advisor/ceo-advisor/` and `../../c-level-advisor/cto-advisor/` updated to `../../c-level-advisor/skills/ceo-advisor/` and `../../c-level-advisor/skills/cto-advisor/` respectively (correct path; the bundled skills live under `skills/`)
  - YAML `skills:` field also corrected (was `c-level-advisor/ceo-advisor`, now `c-level-advisor/skills/ceo-advisor`)
- **karpathy-coder/diff_surgeon:** clean on staged diff

### Why

Both gaps were carry-over items noted across multiple PRs in this session (v2.5.1 → v2.5.5) per karpathy principle #3 (surgical scope — no unrelated cleanups inside scoped feature PRs). This dedicated cleanup PR addresses them in one focused change without touching any feature work.

### Changed

- `c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/references/persona-voices.md` — 13 → 13 voice specs cataloged (all cs-* agents in the persona-voices list now match the agents that exist)
- `agents/c-level/cs-ceo-advisor.md` — 32 path corrections
- `agents/c-level/cs-cto-advisor.md` — 25 path corrections

No skill/agent/command count changes; no manifest version bumps (this is a pure-fix PR).

## [2.5.5] - 2026-05-13 — vpe-advisor: throughput-first VP of Engineering

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **vpe-advisor** skill (`./c-level-advisor/skills/vpe-advisor/`) — opinionated throughput-first VP of Engineering skill. Fifth decision-driven C-role skill in the founder-mode lineup (after GC, CDO, CAIO, CCO). Covers four specific decisions distinct from CTO:
  1. **Are we delivering at the right throughput?** (DORA 4 metrics + bottleneck identification)
  2. **How do we scale the eng hiring funnel?** (7-stage funnel + pipeline gap + weakest-stage fix)
  3. **What's our eng team structure — when to add a tech-lead manager?** (squad/tribe + manager-trigger + span-of-control)
  4. **What's our production discipline?** (on-call, deployment cadence, postmortem culture, SLO discipline — reference-only)
- **Critical distinction enforced:** VPE is NOT a CTO skill. CTO owns *what to build* (architecture, scaling cliffs, build-vs-buy). VPE owns *how to ship it* (delivery operations, hiring execution, team structure, production discipline). At early stage these are often the same person; at scale they're distinct roles.
- **3 stdlib Python tools with deterministic logic:**
  - **`delivery_throughput_analyzer.py`** — Returns DORA 4 metrics (Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, MTTR, Change Failure Rate) with Elite/High/Medium/Low verdict per metric and overall. Cycle-time bottleneck identification (top wait stage as % of cycle) with typical fixes per bottleneck (review queue, CI flakiness, deploy gates, scheduled releases). Embedded sample (30-day Platform Squad, 28 deploys) → overall High; bottleneck = first_review_to_approval at 45.8% of cycle.
  - **`eng_hiring_funnel_calculator.py`** — Stage-by-stage conversion rates for 7-stage funnel (Applied → Sourcer → Recruiter → Hiring Mgr → Tech → Onsite → Offer → Accept) with healthy/leaky verdict per stage. End-to-end conversion rate, required top-of-funnel volume for hiring target, weakest-stage identification with fixes (sourcing channel diversification, calibration, interview design, comp/close discipline). Embedded sample (Q2 2026, 4-engineer hiring target) → 0.62% end-to-end, gap of 160 candidates, weakest = offer_extended_to_offer_accepted at 60%.
  - **`eng_team_structure_designer.py`** — Recommended structure (informal pods / formal squads / squads+tribes / multi-tribe) based on headcount. Squad sizing assessment (5-9 IC healthy range). Manager-trigger (first EM at 5-7 ICs; EM-overstretched > 10 ICs; EM-underutilized < 4 ICs). Director-trigger (3+ EMs reporting directly to VPE/CTO). Embedded sample (25-engineer team, 22 ICs / 3 EMs / 1 CTO) → 4-squad structure, no EM trigger (3 EMs for 22 ICs = healthy 7.3 per EM), director trigger FIRES (3 EMs report directly to CTO).
- **4 in-depth references each citing 5+ authoritative sources:**
  - `delivery_throughput.md` — Full DORA framework with thresholds + 4 common bottlenecks + what to fix first (lead time → failure rate → frequency → MTTR) + 4 anti-patterns. Cites Accelerate (Forsgren/Humble/Kim), Google State of DevOps annual report, The Phoenix Project, Reinertsen Flow, Newman Microservices, Humble Continuous Delivery, Atlassian/GitHub/GitLab benchmarks.

Cites Google SRE (Beyer/Jones/Petoff/Murphy), SRE Workbook, John Allspaw postmortem writings, PagerDuty Incident Response docs, Charity Majors observability, Nora Jones chaos engineering, Mikey Dickerson reliability hierarchy.
- **cs-vpe-advisor** agent (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/agents/cs-vpe-advisor.md`) — throughput-first operator. Voice: "What's your cycle time, and where does the work spend most of its time waiting?" Trusts DORA metrics over vibe. Refuses to recommend hires without naming the throughput or quality bottleneck they unblock.
- **`/cs:vpe-review`** slash command (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/skills/vpe-review/SKILL.md`) — 6-question forcing interrogation: cycle time + waits, DORA verdict, hiring funnel leakage, team structure health, production discipline maturity, VPE-vs-CTO scope decision.
- **cs-vpe-advisor voice spec** added to `persona-voices.md`.
- **Dual-published from the start:** standalone plugin at `c-level-advisor/vpe-advisor/` with mirrored content (per #624 pattern). `sync_skill_bundles.py` keeps both copies aligned.

### Why This Matters

The single most-asked staffing question at Series B is: "Do we need a VPE separately from the CTO?" This skill makes the decision mechanical:

- If CTO is spending > 50% on management vs strategy, VPE is needed
- If CTO is a co-founder more comfortable with strategy than execution, VPE complements
- At small scale (< 20 eng), one person can do both — but the operating decisions still need to be made

Existing skills don't quite own these decisions: cs-cto-advisor is about architecture; cs-engineering-lead is day-to-day incident coordination; cs-chro-advisor owns hiring SYSTEMS company-wide but not eng-specific funnel execution. VPE fills the gap with deterministic frameworks for delivery operations.

### Built with Karpathy-Coder Discipline (5th Consecutive PR)

Maintained the discipline established in v2.5.2:

- **Principle 1:** assumptions surfaced upfront, including the critical CTO-vs-VPE distinction. Locked direction before code.
- **Principle 2:** rejected generic "engineering operations survey" framing. Each tool/reference covers ONE decision. No overlap with engineering tactical skills (`engineering/slo-architect/`, `engineering/feature-flags-architect/`, etc.).
- **Principle 3:** touched only files in the locked plan. No "while I'm here" cleanup. No edits to other c-level skills.
- **Principle 4:** all 3 Python tools smoke-tested with embedded samples before commit. Verifiable outputs (DORA overall High; hiring gap +160 candidates; 25-eng team → 4 squads, director trigger fired).

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 267 → 268 (+1 vpe-advisor)
- **cs-* agents:** 32 → 33 (+1 cs-vpe-advisor in c-level-agents plugin)
- **/cs:* slash commands:** 20 → 21 (+1 /cs:vpe-review)
- **Python tools:** 370 → 373 (+3 in vpe-advisor/scripts/)
- **References:** 502 → 506 (+4 in vpe-advisor/references/)
- **Marketplace plugins:** 38 → 39 (+1 standalone vpe-advisor entry)
- **c-level-skills** plugin: v2.5.4 → v2.5.5 (description expanded; 32 → 33 skills, 12 → 13 cs-* agents)
- **c-level-agents** plugin: v1.4.0 → v1.5.0 (description expanded with VPE; new agent + command; +`vp-engineering`, `vpe`, `dora`, `delivery-throughput`, `engineering-hiring`, `eng-team-structure`, `production-discipline` keywords)

### Known follow-ups (NOT in this PR per surgical scope)

- `cs-general-counsel-advisor` voice spec still missing from `persona-voices.md` (carried from v2.5.1; multi-PR carry-over)
- Phase 2 final remainder (1 role): CCO-comms (Chief Communications Officer) — naming conflict with CCO (Chief Customer Officer); needs disambiguation before adding

### Disclaimer

DORA benchmarks come from cross-industry research; specific thresholds shift with stage and complexity. Hiring funnel benchmarks vary by role level + geography. This skill provides operating-baseline guidance; pair with cs-cto-advisor (architecture), cs-chro-advisor (hiring systems), and engineering tactical skills for execution.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-05-13 — chief-customer-officer-advisor: retention-obsessed CCO

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **chief-customer-officer-advisor** skill (`./c-level-advisor/skills/chief-customer-officer-advisor/`) — opinionated, retention-obsessed CCO skill. Fourth decision-driven C-role skill in the founder-mode lineup. Covers four specific decisions (not generic CS survey):
  1. **What's our retention architecture — and is gross retention vs NRR honest?** (decomposition + 7-category churn taxonomy)
  2. **How do we segment customers for differential investment?** (4-tier framework + ICP fit scoring + kill list)
  3. **What's the CS team's coverage model — and when do we go pooled vs named?** (ratio math + manager trigger)
  4. **What CS role do we hire next?** (stage-to-role map; CSM ≠ Support ≠ AM ≠ IM)
- **3 stdlib Python tools with deterministic logic:**
  - **`retention_decomposition_analyzer.py`** — Decomposes ARR retention by cohort into GRR (truth) / NRR (vanity if alone) / Logo Retention separately. Flags leaky-bucket pattern (NRR > 100% AND GRR < 85%). Categorizes churn across 7-category root-cause taxonomy (product_fit / competitor_loss / no_value_realized / pricing / champion_left / company_event / tactical_failure) and computes preventable % (CS-controllable). Embedded sample: 2 cohorts, Q1 GRR 91.7% CONCERNING (NRR too low at 106.7%), Q2 GRR 84.7% CRITICAL (declining trend), top driver = product_fit at 54.5% preventable.
  - **`customer_segmentation_designer.py`** — Assigns 4-tier segment (Strategic / Enterprise / Mid-market / SMB-long-tail) by ARR. Scores ICP fit 0-10 from 7 weighted signals (industry, size, workflow, exec sponsor, advocacy, expansion potential, competitor concentration). Surfaces kill list (support cost > 50% of ARR AND ICP fit < 5) with the 3 paths (non-renewal / downgrade-to-tech-touch / raise-price). Surfaces upgrade candidates (high fit + expansion potential).
  - **`cs_coverage_calculator.py`** — Calculates required CSM headcount per tier with two constraints (ARR ratio AND account count, whichever is binding). Surfaces manager-trigger thresholds (5+ ICs in tier OR 8+ across function). Generates 12-month hiring plan with quarterly sequencing. Includes fully-loaded cost projection.
- **4 in-depth references each citing 5+ authoritative sources:**
  - `retention_decomposition.md` — GRR vs NRR honest math + leaky-bucket pattern + 7-category churn taxonomy + leading-indicator playbook + cohort discipline. Cites Mehta/Steinman/Murphy "Customer Success", Lincoln Murphy, David Skok (forEntrepreneurs), BVP State of the Cloud, ChartMogul/ProfitWell benchmarks, Reichheld "The Loyalty Effect", Tomasz Tunguz.

- **cs-cco-advisor** agent (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/agents/cs-cco-advisor.md`) — retention-obsessed pragmatist. Voice: "What's your gross retention rate, and what's the #1 reason customers leave?" Trusts gross retention over NRR. Refuses to recommend CS hires without naming the customer outcome they unblock.
- **`/cs:cco-review`** slash command (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/skills/cco-review/SKILL.md`) — 6-question forcing interrogation: GRR (not NRR), top churn driver, time-to-value, kill-list candidates, ARR-per-CSM ratio + coverage model, CS comp alignment.
- **cs-cco-advisor voice spec** added to `persona-voices.md`.
- **Dual-published from the start:** standalone plugin at `c-level-advisor/chief-customer-officer-advisor/` with mirrored content (per the same pattern as #624 for GC/CDO/CAIO). `sync_skill_bundles.py` keeps both copies aligned.

### Why This Matters

By 2026, every B2B SaaS founder is being asked a board-level question: "What's your NRR?" The truth is that NRR alone is the vanity metric — it can hide a leaky bucket where 85% gross retention is masked by expansion from the survivors. This skill enforces the discipline of decomposition before reporting, and surfaces three decisions the other C-roles can't quite own:

- **CRO** owns the revenue math (NRR, expansion comp, ramp); **CCO** owns customer *experience* and the 7-category churn root cause analysis. Clean split.
- **CPO** owns product roadmap; **CCO** surfaces product gaps via churn data. CPO decides; CCO feeds.
- **CHRO** owns CS team comp; **CCO** designs the coverage model + ratios. CHRO executes; CCO designs.

The differential-investment framework (kill list + upgrade candidates) is the strategically distinct CCO contribution. Most founders avoid the kill-list conversation; this skill makes it mechanical.

### Built with Karpathy-Coder Discipline (fourth consecutive PR)

Maintained the discipline established in v2.5.2:

- **Principle 1:** assumptions surfaced upfront, including the CRO vs CCO split assumption (revenue math vs customer experience). Locked direction before code.
- **Principle 2:** rejected generic "customer success survey" framing. Each tool/reference covers ONE decision. No overlap with `business-growth/customer-success-management/`.
- **Principle 3:** touched only files in the locked plan. No "while I'm here" cleanup of unrelated files. No edits to other c-level skills.
- **Principle 4:** all 3 Python tools smoke-tested with embedded samples before commit. Verifiable outputs (Q1 GRR 91.7% CONCERNING / Q2 GRR 84.7% CRITICAL; 5 customers tiered with 1 kill + 2 upgrade candidates; 4 → 12 CSMs / $2.25M annual cost at 40% growth).

### Known follow-ups (NOT in this PR per surgical scope)

- The `cs-general-counsel-advisor` voice spec is still missing from `persona-voices.md` (carried from v2.5.1). Will be addressed in a separate small PR.
- Phase 2 remainder (2 more C-roles: VPE engineering execution, CCO-comms) deferred to v2.5.5+.

### Disclaimer

Retention benchmarks vary significantly by ACV, segment, and industry. This skill provides B2B SaaS-baseline guidance; consumer SaaS, marketplaces, and hardware have materially different retention math.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-05-12 — chief-ai-officer-advisor: AI strategy with citations

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **chief-ai-officer-advisor** skill (`./c-level-advisor/skills/chief-ai-officer-advisor/`) — opinionated, eval-demanding CAIO skill covering 4 specific decisions. The third decision-driven C-role skill in the founder-mode lineup, after general-counsel-advisor (v2.5.1) and chief-data-officer-advisor (v2.5.2).
- **4 specific decisions covered** (not a generic AI strategy survey):
  1. **Should we use an API, fine-tune, or build our own?** (model build-vs-buy with 3-year TCO)
  2. **Is this AI use case high-risk under regulation, and how do we govern it?** (EU AI Act + NIST AI RMF + US state patchwork)
  3. **When do we switch from API to self-hosted, and at what cost?** (token economics with breakeven analysis)
  4. **What AI role do we hire next?** (stage-to-role map; AI engineer ≠ ML engineer ≠ research scientist)
- **3 stdlib Python tools with deterministic logic**:
  - **`model_buildvsbuy_calculator.py`** — Returns API / FINE_TUNE / BUILD recommendation, 3-year TCO across 6 path variants (API frontier-premium/economy/open-hosted, fine-tune, self-hosted 70B-class, build-from-scratch), and breakeven analysis. Balances economic crossover with practical feasibility (data availability, ML team capacity, compliance constraints). Embedded sample (B2B customer support, 4M queries/mo) → API recommendation despite economic breakeven crossed, due to no fine-tune data + 1-engineer ML team.
  - **`ai_risk_classifier.py`** — Returns EU AI Act tier (PROHIBITED / HIGH / LIMITED / MINIMAL) with Article-level citations, US state triggers (NYC LL 144, CO AI Act, IL HB 53, CA SB 1001, IL BIPA), industry overlays (FDA AI/ML, ECOA, NAIC AI bulletin), required-controls list, and conformity-assessment flag. Embedded sample (AI hiring screening in EU+NY+CO+IL+CA) → HIGH risk, conformity required, 3 US state triggers, 14 controls. 7 EU AI Act articles cited (5, 6, 9-15, 43, 49, 72).
  - **`ai_cost_economics.py`** — Returns monthly costs at 6 paths (3 API tiers + self-hosted at low/mid/high GPU rates), breakeven monthly tokens, sensitivity to GPU pricing. Embedded sample (5M tokens/day, 750M/mo) → API at $1,500/mo beats self-hosted at $13,450/mo by 9x; breakeven at 6.7B tokens/mo for 70B-class on A100s. Reveals key insight that self-hosted floor (24/7 warm GPUs + ops) makes API economics dominate at typical B2B SaaS scale.
- **4 in-depth references each citing 5+ authoritative sources**:
  - `model_buildvsbuy_strategy.md` — 3 paths with failure modes, 6 fine-tuning approaches (few-shot, prompt eng, RAG, LoRA, full FT, RLHF/DPO, continued pre-training) ranked by cost and use case, decision tree, eval-first discipline.

- **cs-caio-advisor** agent (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/agents/cs-caio-advisor.md`) — eval-demanding realist orchestrating the skill. Voice: "What does this AI need to be good at, and how would you measure it?" Treats every AI use case as a hiring decision; pushes back on AI hype; demands fallback behavior before scale.
- **`/cs:caio-review`** slash command (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/skills/caio-review/SKILL.md`) — 6-question forcing interrogation: eval discipline, hallucination SLO, regulatory tier, model selection, cost trajectory, role-that-unblocks-this.
- **cs-caio-advisor voice spec** added to `persona-voices.md`.

### Why This Matters

By 2026, every founder is making AI decisions that didn't exist 18 months ago — and gstack, general legal counsel, CTOs, and CISOs each only cover part of the picture. The CAIO concerns that this skill uniquely owns:

1. **Model build-vs-buy is not a single answer.** 80% of B2B SaaS should use frontier APIs; 15% should fine-tune; <1% should pre-train. The decision depends on data availability + team capacity + economics + compliance, not on technology preference.
2. **EU AI Act conformity is consequential and slow.** A high-risk AI use case requires 3-12 months of conformity work + EU database registration + 10 Articles of obligations. Discovering this 2 weeks before EU launch is a category of pain this skill prevents.
3. **API vs self-hosted breakeven is much higher than founders expect.** For 70B-class on rented A100s, breakeven is typically 1-10 billion tokens per month — not the 100M-500M most founders intuit. Self-hosting "to save money" usually wastes engineering capacity.
4. **AI team confusion costs 12 months of productivity.** Hiring a research scientist as first AI hire is the single most common AI hiring mistake, and it's expensive to undo.

### Built with Karpathy-Coder Discipline

Maintained the discipline established in v2.5.2:

- **Principle 1 (Think before coding):** assumptions surfaced upfront before file writes. Locked 4 decisions, 3 tools, 4 references, success criteria. User confirmed direction.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-05-12 — chief-data-officer-advisor: data strategy without surveys

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **chief-data-officer-advisor** skill (`./c-level-advisor/skills/chief-data-officer-advisor/`) — opinionated, decision-driven CDO skill. Refuses to be a generic data-governance survey; instead answers four specific decisions:
  1. **Can we train our model on this data?** (AI training data rights matrix)
  2. **Warehouse, lakehouse, or mesh — and what do we build vs buy?** (data product strategy)
  3. **What is our customer data worth?** (B2B customer-data-as-asset valuation + M&A multiplier)
  4. **What data role do we hire next?** (data team org evolution)
- **3 stdlib Python tools with deterministic logic** (not pattern-match prose):
  - **`ai_training_data_audit.py`** — Audits data sources on 3 dimensions (origin × data class × use case). Returns GO/MITIGATE/NO-GO per source with risk, remediation, and GDPR Art. 6 + EU AI Act + US state citations. Embedded sample tests 7 sources spanning all 3 verdicts. Implements 6+ rule branches (scraped always NO-GO, regulated requires framework-specific consent, PII for fine-tuning requires explicit opt-in, etc.).
  - **`data_product_strategy_picker.py`** — Picks warehouse/lakehouse/mesh from a company profile (stage, consumers, data volume, ML models, culture). Returns architecture + 6-layer build-vs-buy decisions (storage, ELT, modeling, BI, feature store, ML platform) + 12-month sequencing roadmap. Deterministic: same profile → same recommendation. Embedded sample (Series A B2B SaaS, 8 consumers, 4.5TB, 1 ML model) → LAKEHOUSE recommendation.
  - **`data_asset_valuator.py`** — Computes strategic value 0-10 from 4 components (exclusivity, freshness, cohort breadth, history depth), derives moat strength (NONE/WEAK/MEDIUM/STRONG), applies M&A multiplier (1.0x–1.7x ARR depending on moat) with penalties for MSA carve-out rate and failed anonymization audit. Ranks 3 productization paths (benchmark report / embedding endpoint / direct license) by risk + viability. Embedded sample (B2B sales engagement corpus, 380 customers, 47 carve-outs) → 8.2/10 STRONG moat, 1.33-1.61x multiplier, recommends benchmark report as starting path.
- **4 references answering one decision each** (not topic surveys):
  - `ai_training_data_rights.md` — Decision: can we train on this source? Three-dimension matrix + GDPR Art. 6 lawful basis decision tree + EU AI Act high-risk triggers + US state patchwork (CCPA/CPRA, NYC LL 144, IL BIPA, WA MHMD).
  - `data_product_strategy.md` — Decision: which architecture and what do we build? Stage-driven kill criteria per architecture + 6-layer build-vs-buy decision tree + sequencing pattern + anti-patterns.
  - `customer_data_as_asset.md` — Decision: what's our data worth and can we productize it? 5-component valuation framework + M&A multiplier with carve-out impact + 3 productization paths with prerequisites + 10-item M&A diligence prep checklist + quarterly contractual constraint audit pattern.
  - `data_team_org_evolution.md` — Decision: what role next, when to centralize vs embed? 5-stage map (seed → late-stage) with specific role definitions + centralize-vs-embed-vs-federated triggers + 6 anti-patterns ("hiring data scientist as first data hire" etc.).
- **cs-cdo-advisor** agent (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/agents/cs-cdo-advisor.md`) — decision-driven realist orchestrating the skill. Voice: "What decision does this data drive?" Refuses to recommend tooling before naming the consumer. Treats AI training data as both contractual liability and strategic asset.
- **`/cs:cdo-review`** slash command (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/skills/cdo-review/SKILL.md`) — 6-question forcing interrogation pattern matching the /cs:cfo-review / /cs:gc-review etc. shape.
- **cs-cdo-advisor voice spec** added to `persona-voices.md`.

### Why This Matters

By 2026 every B2B SaaS founder is asking three questions the existing C-level skills can't fully answer:
1. **"Can we train our model on customer data?"** — overlaps cs-ciso (security), cs-general-counsel (contracts), and engineering (tactics), but none of them owns the strategic data picture.
2. **"What's the right data architecture — and when?"** — engineering's database-designer and observability-designer cover tactics, but the warehouse-vs-lakehouse-vs-mesh decision is stage-driven, not technology-driven.
3. **"What's our data actually worth in M&A?"** — this comes up at every Series B+ and has no home in existing skills.

This skill fills that gap with **deterministic decision logic** (not survey prose), explicit kill criteria, and a hard rule against duplicating engineering data skills.

### Built with Karpathy-Coder Discipline

This PR was the first in this repo built under explicit karpathy-coder guidance:
- **Principle 1 (Think before coding):** assumptions surfaced upfront, verifiable success criteria locked before any file was written.
- **Principle 2 (Simplicity first):** rejected "generic governance survey" framing; each tool/reference covers ONE decision; refused to add scope ("data product strategy picker" doesn't try to also do data quality, RAG, or schema design).
- **Principle 3 (Surgical changes):** touched only the files in the locked plan. Caught one scope-creep attempt (adding cs-general-counsel-advisor voice spec while editing persona-voices.md) and reverted it — that gap belongs in a separate PR.
- **Principle 4 (Goal-driven execution):** all 3 Python tools smoke-tested with embedded samples before commit (audit: 7 sources → 2 NO-GO / 2 MITIGATE / 3 GO; strategy picker: Series A → LAKEHOUSE; valuator: 8.2/10 STRONG moat).

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 264 → 265 (+1 chief-data-officer-advisor)
- **cs-* agents:** 29 → 30 (+1 cs-cdo-advisor in c-level-agents plugin)
- **/cs:* slash commands:** 17 → 18 (+1 /cs:cdo-review)
- **Python tools:** 361 → 364 (+3 in chief-data-officer-advisor/scripts/)
- **References:** 490 → 494 (+4 in chief-data-officer-advisor/references/)
- **c-level-skills** plugin: v2.5.1 → v2.5.2 (description expanded; 29 → 30 skills, 9 → 10 cs-* agents)
- **c-level-agents** plugin: v1.1.0 → v1.2.0 (description expanded with CDO; new agent; +`chief-data-officer`, `cdo`, `ai-training-data`, `data-product-strategy`, `data-as-asset` keywords)

### Known follow-ups (NOT included this PR per surgical scope)

- The `cs-general-counsel-advisor` voice spec is missing from `persona-voices.md` (introduced in v2.5.1 but not added to the voice reference). Will be addressed in a separate small PR alongside other voice cleanup.
- Phase 2 remainder (4 more C-roles: CAIO AI, CCO customer, VPE engineering execution, CCO comms) deferred to v2.5.3+.

### Disclaimer

The `chief-data-officer-advisor` skill surfaces strategic decisions but is **not legal advice** for AI training, **not a replacement for outside counsel** for productization/licensing decisions, and **not a tactical data engineering skill**. For tactical data engineering, see the engineering/ domain (`database-designer`, `observability-designer`, `data-quality-auditor`, `sql-database-assistant`, `rag-architect`, `llm-cost-optimizer`).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-12 — general-counsel-advisor: the gstack-can't-touch lane

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **general-counsel-advisor** skill (`./c-level-advisor/skills/general-counsel-advisor/`) — full standalone C-role skill backing the `/cs:gc-review` command (which previously had no underlying skill). 2 stdlib Python tools, 3 reference docs.
  - **`contract_risk_scanner.py`** — Scans contract text for 12 founder-killer clause patterns: auto-renewal with long notice (>30 day), customer-indemnity-carved-out-from-cap, one-sided indemnity, vague IP ownership, aggressive non-compete (>1 year), one-sided choice-of-law/venue, one-sided force majeure, missing DPA when personal data flows, MFN pricing, one-sided audit rights, broad non-solicit, perpetual license-back. Outputs ranked findings (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM) with excerpt, why-it-matters, and suggested redline. Stdlib-only, JSON or text output. Embedded sample MSA detects 7 risks across all 3 severity levels.
  - **`term_sheet_analyzer.py`** — Scores a term sheet 0-100 across 12 dimensions: liquidation preference (1x non-participating vs participating vs multi-preference), anti-dilution (broad-based weighted average vs narrow vs full ratchet), option pool (pre-money vs post-money + size), board composition (founder vs investor vs independent seats), vesting + acceleration (single vs double trigger), pro-rata, drag-along (founder consent / price floor), protective provisions (NVCA standard vs aggressive), information rights, dividends (none / non-cumulative / cumulative), valuation/dilution sanity, holistic posture. Outputs FOUNDER_FRIENDLY / NEGOTIATE / HOSTILE grade plus per-clause flags. Stdlib-only, JSON-input + JSON-or-text output.
  - **`references/contracts_playbook.md`** — 7 standard startup contracts (MSA, customer SaaS, NDA, DPA, employment, contractor, equity), top redlines per type, quick triage heuristics.
  - **`references/ip_and_regulatory.md`** — Full IP strategy (patents, copyright, trademark, trade secrets, invention assignment, OSS license compliance for permissive/weak-copyleft/strong-copyleft including AGPL) plus regulatory trigger matrix (HIPAA, PCI DSS, BSA/AML, FDA 510(k), MDR, GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, securities, ITAR, EU AI Act, telehealth, insurance) with SOC 2 → ISO 27001 → ISO 42001 sequencing and when-to-hire-a-GC criteria.
  - **`references/term_sheet_decoder.md`** — Full term sheet glossary, founder-friendly defaults cheat sheet, the three clauses that matter most (liquidation preference, option pool pre/post-money, anti-dilution), and negotiation strategy.
- **cs-general-counsel-advisor** agent (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/agents/cs-general-counsel-advisor.md`) — risk-paranoid persona orchestrating the skill via `/cs:gc-review`. Distinct voice: "Before we sign, three things need to be settled in writing." Hard rule: never gives definitive legal advice; always escalates to qualified outside counsel.
- **`/cs:gc-review`** updated to invoke the new tools and reference the skill (the command previously pointed at a planned skill with a CHANGELOG note).

### Why This Matters

YC Garry Tan's `gstack` has zero coverage for General Counsel — its "executives" are all software-shipping personas (CEO = scope-cutter, Eng Mgr = test matrix). But legal exposure is where startups most often discover a problem after it's expensive to fix: a missed DPA exposes the company to GDPR fines, vague IP clauses kill acquisition deals years later, full-ratchet anti-dilution silently transfers 5-15% of founder equity at the next down round. This is the first plugin in the founder-mode lineup to outclass gstack on a domain it doesn't even attempt.

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 263 → 264 (+1 general-counsel-advisor)
- **cs-* agents:** 28 → 29 (+1 cs-general-counsel-advisor in c-level-agents plugin)
- **Python tools:** 359 → 361 (+2 in general-counsel-advisor/scripts/)
- **References:** 487 → 490 (+3 in general-counsel-advisor/references/)
- **c-level-skills** plugin: v2.5.0 → v2.5.1 (description expanded; 28 → 29 skills, 8 → 9 cs-* agents)
- **c-level-agents** plugin: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 (description expanded with General Counsel; new agent added; +`contract-review`, `term-sheet`, `ip-strategy` keywords)

### Disclaimer

The `general-counsel-advisor` skill and `cs-general-counsel-advisor` agent are **not legal advice**. Every output surfaces questions to bring to qualified counsel; both Python tools and all 3 references repeatedly remind users to engage licensed attorneys for binding decisions. The skill is positioned as a triage layer — useful for catching the obvious traps before $500/hour counsel time, never as a substitute.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-12 — c-level-agents: Founder-Mode Executive Team

### Added — C-Level Advisory

- **c-level-agents** plugin (`./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/`) — surfaces the existing 28 c-level skills through a founder-mode interface of cs-* persona agents and `/cs:*` slash commands. New marketplace entry registered separately (category: leadership).
- **8 new cs-* persona agents** with distinct cognitive voices, completing agent coverage for every C-role:
  - `cs-cfo-advisor` (numerate skeptic) wraps cfo-advisor
  - `cs-cmo-advisor` (narrative-first) wraps cmo-advisor
  - `cs-cro-advisor` (pipeline-paranoid) wraps cro-advisor
  - `cs-cpo-advisor` (JTBD-driven) wraps cpo-advisor
  - `cs-coo-advisor` (execution OS) wraps coo-advisor
  - `cs-chro-advisor` (people-systems) wraps chro-advisor
  - `cs-ciso-advisor` (risk-paranoid) wraps ciso-advisor
  - `cs-chief-of-staff` (router & synthesist) wraps chief-of-staff
- **17 /cs:* slash commands** delivered as sub-skills under `c-level-agents/skills/`:
  - **Forcing-question office hours (8):** `/cs:office-hours` (YC-style 6-question intake), `/cs:cfo-review`, `/cs:cmo-review`, `/cs:cpo-review`, `/cs:cro-review`, `/cs:cto-review`, `/cs:ciso-review`, `/cs:gc-review` (General Counsel — a lane gstack has zero of)
  - **Strategic sprint pipeline (5):** `/cs:brief` → `/cs:boardroom` (6-phase deliberation with Phase 2 isolation + devil's advocate pass) → `/cs:decide` (two-layer memory log with preserved dissent) → `/cs:execute` (90-day plan with weekly milestones + DRIs) → `/cs:post-mortem` (scored against pre-committed criteria and revisited dissent)
  - **Meta + safety (4):** `/cs:founder-mode` (auto-router — the killer command), `/cs:onboard` (12-question founder interview → `~/.claude/company-context.md`), `/cs:cross-eval` (multi-model consensus with graceful degradation to Claude-only adversarial mode when Codex/Gemini absent), `/cs:freeze` (cooldown lock on irreversible decisions with `/cs:unfreeze` audit trail)
- **References:** `c-level-agents/references/persona-voices.md` (voice specs per role — moderate aggression: bookend opening + closing, neutral analysis body) and `c-level-agents/references/llm-wiki-bridge.md` (Markdown-only persistent memory via `llm-wiki` — the answer to gstack's gbrain Postgres+pgvector dependency).
- **c-level-skills marketplace entry** description expanded and version bumped to v2.5.0 to reflect the bundled plugin layer.

### Why This Matters

Garry Tan's `gstack` (~66K stars) demonstrated the power of slash-command-first, forcing-question agent gearing — but its "executives" are all software-shipping personas (CEO = scope-cutter, Eng Mgr = test matrix). This release brings the same pattern to **real business decisions**: CFO with unit economics, CMO with positioning, General Counsel with contract risk, CISO with threat modeling, and a 6-phase boardroom that surpasses gstack's sequential review chain with Phase 2 isolation + adversarial pass. Combined with this repo's pre-existing compliance (ra-qm-team), finance, marketing, business-growth, and product domains, this is the business-domain answer to founder-mode — broader role coverage, real frameworks, Markdown-only memory, and explicit voice differentiation.

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 246 → 263 (+17 from c-level-agents sub-skills)
- **cs-* agents:** 20 → 28 (+8 new c-level personas inside the plugin)
- **Slash commands:** 33 → 50 (+17 /cs:* commands as sub-skills)
- **Marketplace plugins:** 33 → 34 (+1 c-level-agents entry)
- **c-level-skills** plugin: v2.2.3 → v2.5.0

## [2.4.5] - 2026-05-11 — Reliability Portfolio + Count-Truth Reconciliation

### Added — Engineering POWERFUL

- **slo-architect** — End-to-end SLO/SLI/error-budget discipline per Google SRE Workbook. Generates structured SLO definitions and refuses to render if required fields (owner, error-budget policy, SLI numerator/denominator) are missing (`slo_designer.py`). Computes error budget and the canonical multi-window burn-rate alert thresholds — fast (1h/5m, page), slow (6h/30m, page), ticket (3d/6h) — with PromQL-shaped output ready to paste (`error_budget_calculator.py`). Reviews existing SLO docs for the 7 common bugs: target too high (≥99.99%), target too low (≤99%), window too short (<7d), window too long (>90d), no SLI definition, no error budget policy, CPU-as-SLI (`slo_review.py`). 4 references on SLO principles, SLI design (5 types), error budget math, and composition with the rest of the portfolio. Asset templates for SLO YAML and error budget policy. New `/slo-design` slash command. Karpathy complexity 95/100. Composes explicitly with feature-flags-architect (rollout abort uses SLO burn-rate), chaos-engineering (blast-radius bounded by SLO error budget), kubernetes-operator (Capability Level 4 requires SLOs).
- **ship-gate** — Pre-production audit skill from external contributor @rx4u (originally PR #527, re-applied to post-restructure dev layout). Scans codebases across 8 categories — security, database, deployment, code quality, AI/LLM, dependencies, frontend, observability — with 89 automated and manual checks. Intercepts deploy-intent phrases ("push to production", "ship it", "go live") and blocks until critical issues resolve. Stack-agnostic (Node/Next/React/Vue/Svelte/Astro/Express/Python/Django/Flask/etc.). Stdlib-only Python scanner (`ship_gate_scanner.py`, ~1230 LOC) with JSON output, ANSI color, interactive manual prompts, and exit codes (0=CLEAR, 1=CRITICAL, 2=HIGH).
- **feature-flags-architect** — End-to-end feature-flag discipline. Detects stale flags as debt (`flag_debt_scanner.py`), generates phased rollout plans across ring/linear/log/cohort strategies (`rollout_planner.py`), and audits every flag for documented kill switch (`kill_switch_audit.py`). 4 references on flag taxonomy, provider comparison (LaunchDarkly / GrowthBook / Statsig / Unleash / Flipt / DIY), rollout strategies, and lifecycle. Ships standalone plugin AND in the engineering-advanced-skills bundle. New `/flag-cleanup` slash command.
- **kubernetes-operator** — End-to-end Kubernetes Operator discipline. Validates CRDs against operator-pattern best practices (`crd_validator.py`), lints Go reconcile functions for anti-patterns like `time.Sleep`, spec mutation, missing requeue, finalizer imbalance (`reconcile_lint.py`), and scores operators against OperatorHub Capability Levels 1-5 (`operator_capability_audit.py`). 4 references on operator pattern, CRD design, reconcile loop patterns, and framework comparison (controller-runtime / kubebuilder / operator-sdk / metacontroller / KOPF). Asset templates for production CRD YAML and Go controller skeleton (both pass linters). New `/operator-audit` slash command. NOT a generic k8s skill — specifically the Operator pattern. Self-tested: linters caught 4 real bugs in their own asset templates during build.
- **chaos-engineering** — End-to-end chaos engineering discipline. Generates structured experiment plans with hypothesis + steady-state + blast-radius + abort-criteria (`experiment_designer.py`), computes blast radius with GREEN/YELLOW/RED risk score against monthly error budget (`blast_radius_calculator.py`), and produces blameless postmortems with blame-language detection (`experiment_postmortem.py`). 4 references on the 4 founding principles + 5th abort-criteria principle, hypothesis/steady-state/abort design, the 7-attack taxonomy (latency / error / resource / network-partition / dependency / time / infrastructure), and tooling landscape (Chaos Toolkit / Chaos Mesh / Litmus / Gremlin / AWS FIS / DIY). Templates for plans and postmortems. New `/chaos-experiment` slash command. Composes explicitly with feature-flags-architect (kill switches as abort triggers) and kubernetes-operator (operators are common chaos targets). Karpathy complexity 95/100 — best score in the new portfolio.

### Added — Repo infrastructure

- **scripts/sync_skill_bundles.py** — mirror standalone plugin payloads into their domain-bundled location; `--check` exits 1 on drift, `--sync` rewrites the mirror. Locks in the dual-publish invariant for every new skill.
- **scripts/check_plugin_json.py** — strict ClawHub schema validator (exactly 8 fields, semver, `author{name,url}`, `skills` as string or array — bare `"./"` rejected per Claude Code v2.1.107+). Verified against all 31 existing plugin.json files.

### Changed

- **Total skills:** 235 (v2.3.0 claim) → 246 (file-system truth via `find . -name SKILL.md` minus 4 distribution duplicates). +5 new skills this cycle (slo-architect, ship-gate, feature-flags-architect, kubernetes-operator, chaos-engineering); +6 discovered during #608/#609 reconciliation.
- **Python tools:** 314 → 359 (`find . -path '*/scripts/*.py' | wc -l`)
- **References:** 435 → 485 (`find . -path '*/references/*.md' | wc -l`)
- **Agents:** 28 → 27 (file-system truth: 20 `cs-*` + 7 personas. Previous "30" miscounted README/TEMPLATE as agents)
- **Slash commands:** 27 → 33 (`find commands -name '*.md' | wc -l`)
- **Marketplace plugins:** 30 → 33 (registered in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
- **engineering-advanced-skills** plugin: v2.3.3 → v2.4.2
- **marketplace.json**: `feature-flags-architect`, `kubernetes-operator`, and `chaos-engineering` registered as standalone plugins

### Fixed

- `tests/test_skill_integrity.py::TestScriptDirectories::test_scripts_dirs_have_python_files` — was rejecting valid skills shipping `.mjs`/`.js`/`.ts`/`.sh` scripts (e.g., `full-page-screenshot`). Now accepts any executable script extension while keeping the "scripts/ dir is non-empty" intent.
- **#608, #609 — Count claims aligned to ground-truth.** Every metric in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`, `mkdocs.yml`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` now reproduces from a deterministic `find` or `python3 -c "import json"` command. Stale claims of "188 skills", "30 agents", "3 personas", "235 skills" (current-state) were replaced with file-system truth. Per-domain marketplace breakdown also reconciled: engineering-advanced 40→67 unique, engineering-core 32→51, marketing 44→45, c-level 28→34, product 13→17, finance 3→4. Domains ra-qm-team (14), project-management (9), business-growth (5) unchanged.
- **skill-security-auditor** — self-skip false positives via `noqa` directive (the auditor was flagging its own scanner code).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added — Security Skills Suite & Self-Eval

**6 New Security Skills (engineering-team):**
- **adversarial-reviewer** — Adversarial code review with 3 hostile personas (Saboteur, New Hire, Security Auditor) to break self-review monoculture
