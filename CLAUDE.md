# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Purpose

This is a **comprehensive skills library** for Claude AI and Claude Code - reusable, production-ready skill packages that bundle domain expertise, best practices, analysis tools, and strategic frameworks. The repository provides modular skills that teams can download and use directly in their workflows.

**Current Scope:** 265 production-ready skills across 9 domains with 364 Python automation tools, 494 reference guides, 37 agents (30 `cs-*` + 7 personas), and 51 slash commands.

**Key Distinction**: This is NOT a traditional application. It's a library of skill packages meant to be extracted and deployed by users into their own Claude workflows.

### Skill Package Pattern

Each skill follows this structure:
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Master documentation
├── scripts/              # Python CLI tools (no ML/LLM calls)
├── references/           # Expert knowledge bases
└── assets/               # User templates
```

**Design Philosophy**: Skills are self-contained packages. Each includes executable tools (Python scripts), knowledge bases (markdown references), and user-facing templates. Teams can extract a skill folder and use it immediately.

**Key Pattern**: Knowledge flows from `references/` → into `SKILL.md` workflows → executed via `scripts/` → applied using `assets/` templates.

## Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy:** feature → dev → main (PR only)

**Branch Protection Active:** Main branch requires PR approval. Direct pushes blocked.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Always start from dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/agents-{name}

# 3. Work and commit (conventional commits)
feat(agents): implement cs-{agent-name}
fix(tool): correct calculation logic
docs(workflow): update branch strategy

# 4. Push and create PR to dev
git push origin feature/agents-{name}
gh pr create --base dev --head feature/agents-{name}

# 5. After approval, PR merges to dev
# 6. Periodically, dev merges to main via PR
```

**Branch Protection Rules:**
- ✅ Main: Requires PR approval, no direct push
- ✅ Dev: Unprotected, but PRs recommended
- ✅ All: Conventional commits enforced

See [documentation/WORKFLOW.md](documentation/WORKFLOW.md) for complete workflow guide.
See [standards/git/git-workflow-standards.md](standards/git/git-workflow-standards.md) for commit standards.

## Development Environment

**No build system or test frameworks** - intentional design choice for portability.

**Python Scripts:**
- Use standard library only (minimal dependencies)
- CLI-first design for easy automation
- Support both JSON and human-readable output
- No ML/LLM calls (keeps skills portable and fast)

**If adding dependencies:**
- Keep scripts runnable with minimal setup (`pip install package` at most)
- Document all dependencies in SKILL.md
- Prefer standard library implementations

## Current Version

**Version:** v2.5.2 (latest)

**v2.5.2 Highlights — chief-data-officer-advisor: data strategy without surveys:**
- **chief-data-officer-advisor** skill (new, `./c-level-advisor/skills/chief-data-officer-advisor/`) — opinionated, decision-driven CDO skill covering 4 specific decisions (no generic governance survey). 3 stdlib Python tools with deterministic logic: `ai_training_data_audit.py` (origin × class × use-case matrix → GO/MITIGATE/NO-GO with GDPR Art. 6 and EU AI Act citations), `data_product_strategy_picker.py` (warehouse/lakehouse/mesh recommendation + 6-layer build-vs-buy + 12-month sequencing), `data_asset_valuator.py` (strategic value 0-10, moat strength, M&A multiplier with carve-out penalties, 3 ranked productization paths). 4 references answering one decision each: training rights (decision tree + state patchwork), data product strategy (kill criteria per architecture), customer-data-as-asset (valuation + M&A diligence prep), data team org evolution (stage-to-role map). Karpathy-aligned: explicit anti-patterns, decision-driven (not topic-driven), surgical (does not duplicate engineering data skills).
- **cs-cdo-advisor** agent (new) — decision-driven realist orchestrating the skill via `/cs:cdo-review`. Distinct voice: "What decision does this data drive?" Refuses to recommend tooling before naming the consumer.
- **/cs:cdo-review** (new slash command) — 6-question forcing interrogation: decision being made, consent provenance, internal consumers, M&A diligence impact, model-without-this-source viability, role-that-unblocks-this.
- **Built with Karpathy-coder discipline:** explicit assumptions surfaced upfront, verifiable success criteria locked before code, surgical scope (no edits to unrelated files), deterministic tool logic (not pattern-match prose), kill criteria documented in every recommendation.

**Version:** v2.5.1
- **general-counsel-advisor** skill (new, `./c-level-advisor/skills/general-counsel-advisor/`) — full standalone C-role skill backing the existing `/cs:gc-review` command. 2 stdlib Python tools: `contract_risk_scanner.py` (scans contract text for 12 founder-killer patterns: auto-renew traps, uncapped indemnity, vague IP, aggressive non-compete, missing DPA, MFN pricing, perpetual license-back, etc.) and `term_sheet_analyzer.py` (scores term sheets 0-100 across 12 dimensions: liquidation preference, anti-dilution, option pool, board composition, vesting, pro-rata, drag-along, protective provisions, info rights, dividends, valuation/dilution, holistic). 3 references: contracts playbook (7 startup contract types), IP + regulatory landscape (patents, trademark, OSS compliance, HIPAA/GDPR/FDA/fintech triggers, SOC 2 → ISO sequencing), term sheet decoder (full glossary + founder-friendly defaults + negotiation strategy).
- **cs-general-counsel-advisor** agent (new) — risk-paranoid persona orchestrating the skill via `/cs:gc-review`. Distinct voice: "Before we sign, three things need to be settled in writing." Always escalates to outside counsel — never substitutes for it.
- **First plugin to outclass gstack on a domain it has zero coverage in.** Software-shipping personas don't include General Counsel; legal exposure is where startups most often discover problems after they're expensive to fix.
- **/cs:gc-review updated** to invoke the new tools and reference the skill.

**Version:** v2.5.0

**v2.5.0 Highlights — c-level-agents: Founder-Mode Executive Team:**
- **c-level-agents** plugin (new, `./c-level-advisor/c-level-agents/`) — 8 cs-* persona agents (CFO, CMO, CRO, CPO, COO, CHRO, CISO, Chief of Staff) with moderate voice differentiation, plus 17 /cs:* slash commands surfaced as sub-skills.
- **Forcing-question office hours (8):** `/cs:office-hours` (YC-style 6-Q intake), and per-role `/cs:cfo-review`, `/cs:cmo-review`, `/cs:cpo-review`, `/cs:cro-review`, `/cs:cto-review`, `/cs:ciso-review`, `/cs:gc-review` (General Counsel — a lane gstack lacks entirely).
- **Strategic sprint pipeline (5):** `/cs:brief` → `/cs:boardroom` (6-phase deliberation with Phase 2 isolation + devil's-advocate pass) → `/cs:decide` (two-layer memory + preserved dissent) → `/cs:execute` (90-day plan) → `/cs:post-mortem` (scored against pre-committed criteria).
- **Meta + safety (4):** `/cs:founder-mode` (auto-router), `/cs:onboard` (12-Q founder interview), `/cs:cross-eval` (multi-model consensus with graceful Claude-only fallback), `/cs:freeze` (cooldown lock on irreversible decisions).
- **References:** `persona-voices.md` (voice specs) and `llm-wiki-bridge.md` (Markdown-only persistent memory — answer to gstack's gbrain Postgres dependency).
- Positioned as the business-domain answer to YC Garry Tan's gstack: broader role coverage, real frameworks (RICE/JTBD/OKR/ADKAR/Wardley/8-dim health), compliance lane (ra-qm-team), explicit voice differentiation, and stdlib-only memory.

**Version:** v2.4.5

**v2.4.x Highlights — Reliability Portfolio (Phase 1–4):**
- **slo-architect** (Phase 4 — keystone) — SLO/SLI/error-budget discipline per Google SRE Workbook. 3 stdlib Python tools (`slo_designer`, `error_budget_calculator` with multi-window burn-rate alerts, `slo_review`), 4 reference docs, asset templates, `/slo-design` slash command. Engineering-advanced bundle 49 → 50.
- **chaos-engineering** (Phase 3) — experiment designer, blast-radius calculator, postmortem generator. `/chaos-experiment` command.
- **kubernetes-operator** (Phase 2) — CRD validator, reconcile linter, capability auditor. `/operator-audit` command.
- **feature-flags-architect** (Phase 1) — flag debt scanner, rollout planner, kill-switch audit. `/flag-cleanup` command.
- **ship-gate** — pre-production audit skill (89 checks across 8 categories, stdlib-only, MIT). External contribution.
- **Atlassian Remote MCP** — bundled `.mcp.json` in `project-management/` (SSE transport, OAuth handled by Claude Code, no env vars required).
- **Auditor + CI cleanup** — `.mcp.json` allowlist in skill-security-auditor, manifest-only PRs skip audit, README links (toprank).
- 246 total skills, 359 Python tools, 485 references, 27 agents, 33 commands.

**v2.3.0 Highlights:**
- **llm-wiki plugin** — new POWERFUL-tier skill implementing Karpathy's LLM Wiki pattern. Second brain for Claude Code + Obsidian where the LLM incrementally ingests sources into a persistent, interlinked markdown vault. Ships SKILL.md (with `context: fork`), 3 sub-agents (wiki-ingestor, wiki-librarian, wiki-linter), 5 slash commands (/wiki-init, /wiki-ingest, /wiki-query, /wiki-lint, /wiki-log), 8 stdlib-only Python tools, 8 reference guides, full vault templates, and a worked example. Cross-tool compatible with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Antigravity, OpenCode, Gemini CLI.
- **tc-tracker** — new engineering skill: task context tracker with lifecycle, handoff format, schema, and 5 Python tools (tc_init, tc_create, tc_update, tc_status, tc_validator) plus `/tc` slash command
- **apple-hig-expert** — new product skill: Apple Human Interface Guidelines expert with Liquid Glass aesthetic focus. Audits iOS/macOS/visionOS apps with `hig_checker` Python tool and comprehensive reference docs on visual design, platform specifics, and accessibility
- 235 total skills, 314 Python tools, 435 references, 28 agents, 27 commands

See domain-specific roadmaps in each skill folder's README.md or roadmap files.

## Key Principles

1. **Skills are products** - Each skill deployable as standalone package
2. **Documentation-driven** - Success depends on clear, actionable docs
3. **Algorithm over AI** - Use deterministic analysis (code) vs LLM calls
4. **Template-heavy** - Provide ready-to-use templates users customize
5. **Platform-specific** - Specific best practices > generic advice

## ClawHub Publishing Constraints

This repository publishes skills to **ClawHub** (clawhub.com) as the distribution registry. The following rules are **non-negotiable**:

1. **cs- prefix for slug conflicts only.** When a skill slug is already taken on ClawHub by another publisher, publish with the `cs-` prefix (e.g., `cs-copywriting`, `cs-seo-audit`). The `cs-` prefix applies **only on the ClawHub registry** — repo folder names, local skill names, and all other tools (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) remain unchanged.
2. **Never rename repo folders or local skill names** to match ClawHub slugs. The repo is the source of truth.
3. **No paid/commercial service dependencies.** Skills must not require paid third-party API keys or commercial services unless provided by the project itself. Free-tier APIs and BYOK (bring-your-own-key) patterns are acceptable.
4. **Rate limit: 5 new skills per hour** on ClawHub. Batch publishes must respect this. Use the drip timer (`clawhub-drip.timer`) for bulk operations.
5. **plugin.json schema** — ONLY these fields: `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `homepage`, `repository`, `license`, `skills`. No extra fields. The `skills` value depends on the plugin layout (Claude Code v2.1.107+ rejects bare `"./"`):
   - Single-skill plugin (SKILL.md at root): `"skills": ["./"]` (array form required).
   - Plugin with `./skills/` subdir: `"skills": "./skills"`.
   - Multi-skill domain plugin (skills are subfolders at root): `"skills": ["./sub1", "./sub2", ...]` (explicit list, omit `"./"` to avoid namespace collision with the index SKILL.md).
6. **Version follows repo versioning.** ClawHub package versions must match the repo release version (currently v2.2.0+).

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating dependencies between skills (keep each self-contained)
- Adding complex build systems or test frameworks (maintain simplicity)
- Generic advice (focus on specific, actionable frameworks)
- LLM calls in scripts (defeats portability and speed)
- Over-documenting file structure (skills are simple by design)

## Working with This Repository

**Creating New Skills:** Follow the appropriate domain's roadmap and CLAUDE.md guide (see Navigation Map above).

**Editing Existing Skills:** Maintain consistency across markdown files. Use the same voice, formatting, and structure patterns.

**Quality Standard:** Each skill should save users 40%+ time while improving consistency/quality by 30%+.
